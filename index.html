  <h1>NIH Topic Explorer</h1>

  <h2>Project Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This project uses AI-powered topic modeling to uncover and visualize the main research themes in NIH-funded grant applications. 
    Each proposal abstract is grouped into a research "topic" using clustering algorithms (k-means). 
    We then visualize how common each topic is and which NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) fund research in those areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What you can explore:</strong><br>
    â€“ Which research topics are most common (left bar chart)<br>
    â€“ Which NIH ICs fund each topic (right bubble chart)<br>
    â€“ Multiple levels of detail (k = 5, 10, 15, 20)
  </p>
  <p>
    This tool helps researchers, policymakers, and the public understand how NIH distributes funding across scientific themes.

  <h2>How to Read the Visualizations</h2>
  <p><strong>Left chart:</strong> Bars show how many applications each research topic hasâ€”the longer the bar, the more applications. Topic names appear next to the bars, sorted from most (top) to least (bottom).</p>
  <p><strong>Right chart:</strong> For each topic row, circles under IC codes show which NIH institutes fund that topic; bigger circles mean more applications. Hovering reveals the full institute name and count.</p>
  <p><strong>How to read both:</strong> First look at bar length to see which topics are busiest, then check that topicâ€™s row of circles to see which institutes are most involved.</p>
