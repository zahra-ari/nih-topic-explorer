  <h1>NIH Topic Explorer</h1>

  <p><strong>Left chart:</strong> Bars show how many applications each research topic hasâ€”the longer the bar, the more applications. Topic names appear next to the bars, sorted from most (top) to least (bottom).</p>
  <p><strong>Right chart:</strong> For each topic row, circles under IC codes show which NIH institutes fund that topic; bigger circles mean more applications. Hovering reveals the full institute name and count.</p>
  <p><strong>How to read both:</strong> First look at bar length to see which topics are busiest, then check that topicâ€™s row of circles to see which institutes are most involved.</p>
