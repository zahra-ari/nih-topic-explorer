The only currently available treatment is liver transplantation. The pathobiology of the liver disease begins with a point mutation in α1-antitrypsin (α1-antitrypsin), one of the most abundant secretory glycoproteins of the liver. The variant, α1-antitrypsin Z (α1-antitrypsinZ), is prone to misfolding and that leads to its accumulation within the early part of the secretory pathway of liver cells. Most of the α1-antitrypsinZ accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (endoplasmic reticulum) as polymers and aggregates, and we now know that it is this accumulation of polymerogenic, aggregation-prone α1-antitrypsinZ that initiates the process of liver damage by a gain-of-toxic function mechanism. Very little is known about the pathobiological steps after accumulation of α1-antitrypsinZ that result in liver damage but it is assumed that liver cell function becomes impaired with stereotypical fibrogenic consequences. Marked alterations of mitochondria have been observed in liver cells of human 1-antitrypsin deficiency patients and the PiZ mouse model of 1-antitrypsin deficiency, leading to speculation that mitochondrial dysfunction is at least part of the final steps in the demise of liver cell function that characterizes severe 1-antitrypsin deficiency liver disease. Over the years we have learned that only a sub-group of homozygotes for α1-antitrypsinZ develop progressive liver disease and the majority completely escape clinical effects. This observation has led to the recognition that genetic and environmental modifiers play an important role in the pathobiological effects of α1-antitrypsinZ. Work led by the Perlmutter laboratory has shown that the intracellular degradation pathway known as autophagy is a key determinant of α1-antitrypsinZ accumulation in liver cells and that drugs which enhance the autophagic degradation of α1-antitrypsinZ decrease hepatic fibrosis in animal models, including the α1-antitrypsinZ nematode and PiZ mouse models. Other recent studies have shown specificity for the molecular pathways involved in autophagy of specific organelles, and the term `endoplasmic reticulum-phagy' has recently been recognized as at least part of the process by which α1-antitrypsinZ is specifically degraded. Furthermore, a very important new study has shown that at least one endoplasmic reticulum-phagy pathway is regulated by oxidative phosphorylation genes and mitochondrial function. Based on these considerations and new preliminary data described in the proposal, we now believe that mitochondrial impairment is a key part of the pathobiology of 1-antitrypsin deficiency liver disease in two ways, impaired liver cell energy metabolism and reduced autophagic response, and, therein, that mitochondrial function is a very appealing target for potential therapeutic interventions. In this grant we propose to investigate the effects of α1-antitrypsinZ accumulation on mitochondrial function to better understand the mechanism by which liver is damaged and to investigate whether mitochondrial function can be targeted for therapy. Our overarching goal with these studies is to provide a basis for clinical trials of human 1-antitrypsin deficiency liver disease that target mitochondrial dysfunction.",5,5R01DK131215-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,12,2,0,0

Of those patients, only approximately 8-10 thousand are surgically treated. This undertreatment of patients with functional tricuspid valve regurgitation has been declared ""a public health crisis"". While the reasons for undertreatment are multi-fold, one is unarguably that available treatment options have suboptimal outcomes while being high-risk; thus, tilting the risk-benefit scale toward conservative treatment. For example, functional tricuspid valve regurgitation recurs in as many as 10-30% of patients treated via the gold-standard surgical technique tricuspid valve annuloplasty. Additionally, mortality rates of reoperation are exorbitantly high (>30%). Clearly, better therapeutic approaches are needed to treat functional tricuspid valve regurgitation and to stop undertreatment of a large patient population. Our collaborative team has recently shown in two separate sheep models that the tricuspid valve leaflets grow and fibrotically remodel in functional tricuspid valve regurgitation. The discovery of tricuspid valve (mal)adaptation now raises the possibility to both harness the valve's native ability to grow, and thereby counteract disease, and to therapeutically target leaflet fibrosis. However, before being able to use our new knowledge toward improving treatment of functional tricuspid valve regurgitation and toward overcoming today's massive undertreatment, tricuspid valve maladaptation must be better understood: To date, we don't know its stimuli, the mechanisms of its detrimental effects on valve function, or how therapy may be used to suppress fibrosis. The objective of this current proposal is to overcome these gaps in knowledge. To this end, we will test our central hypothesis that disease-induced leaflet strains stimulate leaflet maladaptation which, in turn, hinders valve coaptation and contributes to functional tricuspid valve regurgitation, and that leaflet maladaptation may be halted by counteracting disease-induced stimuli. We will pursue our objective in three aims: 1) Identify the stimuli of tricuspid valve maladaptation, 2) Delineate the mechanisms through which maladaptation impedes valve function, 3) Test whether prophylactic intervention halts maladaptation. To accomplish these aims, we will combine innovative, chronic sheep models with in-vitro flow loop valve characterization using high-speed 3D imaging, and extensive mechanical, compositional, and biological tissue phenotyping. Our team has a long collaborative track record of studying tricuspid valve function and disease, and is supported by a senior colleague with 30 years of experience in in-vitro valve experimentation. Upon conclusion of this work, we expect to have identified the stimuli for tricuspid valve maladaptation, understand the mechanisms through which it impedes valve function, and have shown that it can be halted through surgical intervention. Thus, we will have shed light on a recently identified disease mechanism of the tricuspid valve and suggested it as a novel therapeutic target. Our work will therefore pave the way toward a better understanding and better treatment of functional tricuspid valve regurgitation as a public health crisis. While our work is surgically-focused, it is equally important to transcatheter repair strategies which amplifies the significance of our work and its impact.",5,5R01HL165251-03,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,2,0,0

The airway tree is the first line of defense against these ubiquitous noxious agents and, according to textbooks, has a fairly standard anatomy. During the first funding period, we confirmed our primary hypothesis and found that approximately 25% of the general population have airway branch variants that modify susceptibility to cigarette smoke (published in PNAS). Further epidemiologic investigation of airway tree structure on computed tomography (computed tomography) in multiple cohorts demonstrated that variation in native airway tree caliber (""dysanapsis"") is common and predicts incident chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) better than smoking (published in JAMA) and extends to the terminal bronchioles. These new findings suggest that native airway tree caliber is fundamental to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk and may modify susceptibility to inhale particulates including cigarette smoke. This renewal therefore proposes to 1) establish the early-life origins of airway tree caliber to identify possible modifiable factors, 2) investigate the pathophysiology of increased susceptibility to inhaled noxious agents in adults, and 3) define resilient vs susceptible airway tree structure using clinical outcomes We will use new and existing data, and proven expertise in cohort epidemiology, lung imaging, tobacco and air pollution assessment and gene expression to address the following aims: Aim 1 Using radiation-free innovative MR lung imaging, we will establish the early-life origin of airway tree caliber variation that is physiologically relevant among adolescents (n=100) in a well-characterized mulit-ethnic birth cohort. 1a Explore if smaller airway tree caliber is associated with prospectively ascertained and modifiable early-life factors. Aim 2 Investigate two candidate pathophysiologic mechanisms linking airway tree caliber to increased susceptibility to tobacco smoke and other noxious pollutants: 2a: Mechanism 1 (higher dose delivered): Determine if smaller airway tree caliber is associated with i) higher baseline and prospective accumulation of lung macrophage black carbon content (n=554), and ii) higher systemic biomarker levels of tobacco smoke exposure and inflammation (n=6,570). 2b: Mechanism 2 (impaired airway homeostasis): Determine if smaller airway tree caliber is associated with attenuated basal progenitor cell expression signature among never smokers (n=40) and an 'exhausted' basal cell gene expression response to smoking with higher expression of airway inflammation (n=207). Aim 3 Identify the threshold of airway tree caliber that defines resilient versus susceptible airway tree caliber using existing cardiac and full-lung computed tomography measures and clinical outcomes with up to 21 years of follow-up (n=9,664). 3a: Test whether airway tree caliber modifies the risk of death associated with tobacco smoking. The proposed R01 renewal builds upon high-impact prior work and seeks to understand and ultimately target resilient airway tree development and maintenance across the lifespan and improve population health in the 21st century.",5,5R01HL130506-08,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",3,4,0,3

UCSF is a current member of the APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network Consortium. This Consortium was established in 2017 to work seamlessly with the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations (Association of Organ Procurement Organizations) to enroll participants in the largest observational study to date of kidney transplant recipients and donors to evaluate APOL1 gene mutations as a risk factor for graft loss. Our Clinical Center has been a leader on the West Coast, collaborating with our sites at University of California Los Angeles, University of California Davis (University of California Davis), California Pacific Medical Center (California Pacific Medical Center), Stanford University, and University of Southern California. In Phase 1 or APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network, we have successfully enrolled a total of 223 participants across these centers, with DNA specimens in hand for 221/223. Our site has overseen the careful collection of clinical data from the electronic medical record at our own site and those of our engaged centers to complete the APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network Consortium Data forms accurately and completely. In Phase 2, we will continue to obtain critical follow-up data on all participants and ensure completion of data abstraction from electronic medical record continues at our engaged sites, to provide patient-level detail not available in databases maintained by United Network for Organ Sharing (United Network for Organ Sharing) and the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients). We will ensure a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is measured in all participants, at all sites, at a longitudinal follow-up time point at least two years after transplantation in APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network Phase 1. We will collect additional biospecimens for contribution to the biorespository as well as unstained biopsy slides as we have been doing through Phase 1. We will work with the Scientific Data and Coordinating Center to ensure return of genotype results to all study participants who desire this information. We will also continue to recruit living donors at our site. Continuation of the APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network Consortium will lead to important advances in our understanding of APOL1 high-risk status and its influence on graft function as well as the biology of APOL1 gene effects.",5,5U01DK116043-07,RFA-DK-22-506,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,19,4,0,3

However, the PET evaluation criteria currently used for assessing lymphoma, which consists of subjective visual scoring on a 5-point scale, is suboptimal. The visual scores suffer from high interobserver variability and have low prognostic power for new emerging biological therapies. Quantitative PET metrics have been shown to be more predictive of clinical outcomes than visual scores, but quantitative analysis of whole-body PET/CT images is prohibitively time-consuming and impractical in routine clinical care. Deep learning (Deep learning) has shown promise in automating the quantitative analysis of baseline 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT images, but comprehensive evaluation of interim-therapy and post-therapy images using Deep learning has proven difficult. Residual lymphoma has low-level uptake, which can be hard to differentiate from physiologic or treatment-related uptake, and reading physicians must use clinical histories and baseline PET images (i.e., sites of initial disease) to make reliable diagnoses. Deep learning algorithms, on the other hand, only operate on cross-sectional images and are unable to account for historical context. Our objective is to develop Deep learning algorithms that operate on PET/CT images from more than one time point so that algorithms can learn longitudinal dependencies for contextually-aware predictions. We also aim to develop multimodal vision-language models that can simultaneously interpret radiology text reports while performing PET/CT image analysis. These models can leverage critical information about patient history and physician interpretation when processing retrospective images. Furthermore, we will use semi-supervised learning to leverage both unlabeled datasets and labeled datasets. Our overall goal is to develop contextually-aware algorithms for automated longitudinal analysis of whole-body PET/CT images in lymphoma. These tools will be developed using diverse datasets from multiple institutions. PET metrics measured by Deep learning will be validated as predictive markers of outcome using data from a Phase 3 clinical trial.",1,1R01EB033782-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING,17,8,7,0

A major advantage of 19F-MRI is that lack of natural fluorine in the body allows for very high contrast-to-noise for 19F-MRI compared to 1H-MRI.2 Use of 19F-MRI in molecular imaging, by targeting specific biomarkers, is of great interest, but the development of probes for these applications has been an elusive goal. Typical synthetic methods produce relatively large particles, > 150 nm, which induce nonspecific uptake by phagocytic cells. While avid nonspecific uptake is advantageous for labeling T cells and other immune cells ex vivo, it is a decided limitation for imaging of biomarkers as it can create high background signal in the inflamed tissues characteristic in many diseases. 19F MRI should be an excellent platform for biomarker detection but there is a critical unmet need for suitable 19F MRI contrast agents that avoid nonspecific immune cell surveillance. Ideally, contrast agents need to be<100 nm to avoid nonspecific uptake. We propose exploratory studies to develop innovative new 19F MRI contrast agents based on nanodiscs. Nanodiscs are < 50 nm in size, avoid liver clearance, and escape immune surveillance. We hypothesize that nanodiscs, which are structurally similar to high density lipoproteins that carry cholesterol in a hydrophobic core, may be ideal for carrying hydrophobic perfluorocarbons. Our aims are to explore synthetic parameters in benchtop (Aim 1) and microfluidic (Aim 2) approaches to optimize loading of perfluorocarbons into nanodiscs. In each aim we will systematically investigate variables that influence nanodisc size and perfluorocarbon loading. New nanodiscs will be characterized for physical properties such composition and dimensions, and the top 3 products from each Aim will be evaluated for lack of toxicity and biodistribution in a mouse model. The leading nanodiscs will be modified for targeting CD204, a biomarker for tumor associated macrophages, and tested in a mouse breast cancer model. We are team composed of contrast agent (UCD) and nanodisc (LLNL) experts who are ideally positioned and well-equipped to carry out the proposed aims. The success of this project would add novel nanodiscs materials with the potential not only for targeted 19F MR molecular imaging, but for applications in photoacoustic, and radiotherapy, and tracking drug delivery.",5,5R21EB033689-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING,5,0,2,0

In the case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and frontotemporal dementia (frontotemporal dementia), Alzheimer's disease, and other Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (Alzheimer's diseaseRDs), cytoplasmic inclusions of transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa) are observed in a large percentage of patients with sporadic and familial forms of disease. This aberrant accumulation of cytoplasmic transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa is thought to underlie gain of toxic functions and exacerbate loss of nuclear function pathogenic mechanisms; therefore, preventing the formation or promoting the clearance of these inclusions may be an effective therapeutic approach for transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa proteinopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's diseaseRDs. Currently, there are no therapeutics that effectively alter the course of most neurodegenerative diseases associated with transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa proteinopathy. We have recently identified Nemo-like kinase (Nemo-like kinase) as a negative regulator of the lysosome, a key organelle involved in cellular protein quality control that is capable of clearing toxic aggregated proteins. This proposal aims to better understand the basic molecular mechanism of Nemo-like kinase's regulation of lysosome gene expression in the nervous system and to test the modulatory effects of Nemo-like kinase in Alzheimer's diseaseRD animal models of transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa aggregation. We propose the following three specific aims. Aim 1 will employ unbiased and targeted approaches to uncover fundamental mechanistic insights into the regulation of lysosome gene expression by Nemo-like kinase in neurons. Aim 2 will determine which cell types mediate the function of Nemo-like kinase in the regulation of the lysosome and transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa proteinopathy in the nervous system in vivo using wild-type and transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa animal models. Aim 3 will expand the scope of the proposed study to understand the therapeutic implications of Nemo-like kinase reduction in animal models of transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa aggregation through genetic and pharmacological reduction of Nemo-like kinase levels at varying times in adulthood in vivo. In doing so, we will test the effect of Nemo-like kinase reduction in the control of the onset and progression of pathological and motor behavioral changes in transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa mouse models of Alzheimer's diseaseRD. Aims 2 and 3 will provide critical proof-of-principle evidence regarding the effectiveness of lysosomal modulation in pre-clinical models of protein aggregation disorders. Together, this project will reveal novel molecules involved in lysosomal regulation in neurons that may be potential targets in the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and several Alzheimer's disease-related disorders.",5,5R01AG074609-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,2,6,6,1

Co-use of tobacco and cannabis during pregnancy is also more common in minoritized groups and may hinder prenatal smoking cessation and postpartum tobacco abstinence. Depressive symptoms represent a modifiable factor related to discrimination, prenatal tobacco, and prenatal cannabis use that can be addressed to promote perinatal cessation and prevent relapse. To achieve true health equity, effective perinatal tobacco and cannabis use cessation interventions created in partnership with vulnerable communities are necessary. Accordingly, the proposed project is designed to achieve the following aims:  Guided by a community collaborative, we propose to conduct formative research on the experiences of marginalized pregnant people who use cannabis and tobacco, to contextualize the role of depressive symptoms in prenatal dual use. We will co-create an interview guide; conduct interviews with 35 pregnant and parenting people who engage(d) in dual use and experienced prenatal depressive symptoms to determine the relationship among symptoms and tobacco and cannabis use, quit attempts, withdrawal, and relapse. We will code and evaluate themes from these interviews with the collaborative.  Guided by a community collaborative and using an intervention mapping approach, develop an intervention targeting prenatal depressive symptoms for prenatal tobacco and cannabis smoking cessation.  Guided by a community collaborative, conduct a single group, proof of concept feasibility trial of a new intervention designed to address prenatal depressive symptoms to encourage tobacco and cannabis cessation. Together, we will assess needs, choose behavioral targets and review the feasibility and acceptability of the novel intervention to prepare for future evaluation of efficacy. Although there are interventions addressing perinatal depressive symptoms, extant interventions may not be appropriate or effective for pregnant people from minoritized groups who use both cannabis and tobacco. Successful intervention development needs to include members of communities disproportionately affected by discrimination as a core part of the scientific process to better address prenatal smoking cessation. Thus, the project will provide data critical for a novel intervention to reduce prenatal co-use of tobacco and cannabis. The proposed study amplifies the voices of pregnant people from communities with higher rates of prenatal depressive symptoms and dual prenatal tobacco and cannabis use who have been under-represented in tobacco treatment research.",1,1R01DA057946-01A1,PA-20-183,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,6,5,8,2

While these severe and debilitating diseases have a genetic component, as determined from concordance studies in monozygotic twins, we still know very little about how genetics drives risk and progression for each disease. Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of IBD-associated regions of the genome, but there is often tight linkage disequilibrium between causal and non-causal variants in these regions, and most disease-associated genetic variants are in non-coding regions. Thus, determining the variants that promote disease and their effects on disease-relevant cell types is challenging. One cell type that is implicated in IBD is the pathogenic Th17 cell. Th17 cells normally maintain homeostasis of the colonic lamina propria, but in the context of IBD, pathogenic Th17 cells cause unwanted inflammation. Non-coding genetic variants associated with IBD are highly enriched within the accessible chromatin of pathogenic Th17 cells compared to other T cell types. Thus, we hypothesize that disease-causal variants alter cis-regulatory element (cis-regulatory element) activity in pathogenic Th17 cells that may affect their differentiation and function, making them more pathogenic. We recently discovered that we can identify likely causal variants through testing their allele-specific effects on regulatory region activity in massively parallel reporter assays (massively parallel reporter assays). Our massively parallel reporter assays in T and B cell lines and primary T cells identify putative causal variants that are highly cell type and state dependent. Thus, we will perform massively parallel reporter assays on IBD GWAS variants, identified in East Asian and European individuals, using human pathogenic Th17 cells to discover putatively causal IBD variants across the genome. We will then connect variants to their effects on pathogenic Th17 cell migration and function using CRISPR-interference (CRISPR-interference) screens in primary T cells. Next, we will use a single-cell screening approach in pathogenic Th17 cells to identify the genes that variant cis-regulatory elements control. We will then determine gene regulatory networks that variant cis-regulatory elements act on to begin to define important disease pathways. In concert with our studies in human T cells, we will use in vivo CRISPR-interference screens to test conserved variant cis-regulatory element effects on migration and function of pathogenic Th17 cells in a murine model of IBD, thus exploring additional physiological avenues of variant effects in the in vivo setting. If successful, this work will take the first leap in directly linking hundreds of IBD risk loci to the function of a disease-relevant cell type and it will provide insight into how genetic risk promotes disease. Our findings may therefore identify therapeutically targetable pathways for treatment of IBD.",1,1R01DK140972-01,RFA-DK-22-023,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,3,4,1,3

Despite significant progress in the field, the complex mechanisms driving the onset and progression of alcohol-associated liver disease are still not fully understood. cAMP is a second messenger that plays a critical role in regulating multiple cellular functions via its effectors (e.g. protein kinase A). Amplitude and duration of cAMP signaling is fine-tuned by phosphodiesterases (phosphodiesterases) via cAMP hydrolysis and degradation. Our work has shown that ethanol increases expression of hepatic PDE4 in experimental alcohol-associated liver disease as well as in alcohol-associated hepatitis (alcohol-associated hepatitis) patients' livers. However, their role in alcohol-associated liver disease pathogenesis is not clear. We started elucidating the role of PDE4s in alcohol-associated liver disease by demonstrating that Pde4b plays a critical role in ethanolmediated impairment of fatty acid β-oxidation and steatosis. We also showed that inhibition of PDE4 activity attenuates liver injury in in vivo and in vitro models of alcohol-associated liver disease. However, underlying mechanisms of ethanol mediated induction of PDE4 enzymes have not been determined. Moreover, how PDE4 inhibition exerts its beneficial effect on dysregulated lipid metabolism and hepatocytes survival is not fully understood. Our preliminary studies using animal and cell models of alcohol-associated liver disease identified novel pathways of ethanol and PDE4mediated regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and cell injury which have never been examined before. Based on our previous work and preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that ethanol via cytochrome p450 (CYP2E1) mediated increase in hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1α) induces hepatic PDE4 which contributes to dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and injury. The specific objectives of these mechanistic studies are to: Aim 1: Determine the underlying mechanisms of PDE4 upregulation by ethanol in hepatocytes. Aim 2: Determine mechanisms underlying ethanol/PDE4-mediated de novo lipogenesis and hepatic steatosis. Aim 3: Determine the role of MKP1 in ethanol/PDE4-mediated toxicity in hepatocytes. The ultimate goal of this application is to identify not only the mechanisms of PDE4 upregulation, but also the role of PDE4s in the development of alcohol-associated liver disease. Importantly, we predict that these preclinical studies will provide strong rationale using PDE4 specific inhibitors in the treatment of alcohol-associated liver disease. Importantly, there are potent PDE4 inhibitors that are already FDA-approved for the treatment of other inflammatory disease processes, and these inhibitors could potentially be repurposed for alcohol-associated liver disease.",5,5R01AA029798-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM,12,2,0,0

The long-term objective of the project is to unravel how to control tissue fluidity and flows with cells pocessing the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype along the partial epithelial-mesenchymal-transition spectrum. Different from epithelial tissues, partial epithelial-mesenchymal-transition cell monolayers present a unique spatial distribution of force-bearing actin network, and it is not clear how tissue flow and fluidity is facilitated spatiotemporally in the partial epithelial-mesenchymal-transition tissue. The project aims to investigate the fluidity patterning in the partial EMT state at the large-scale tissue level and cell-cell aggregate level. To achieve the goal, we will develop a multiscale theory-experiment framework to elucidate the cell-cell intercalation and large-scale kinematics regulation in the in vitro tissue monolayer induced by a profound wounds. To investigate the distinction of the partial EMT state to the epithelial state in the fluidity control, we will study cell lines with different EMT potential under different treatment conditions that change their extent of partial EMT state and protocols known to perturb cell intercalations and tissue flow. To describe the large-scale tissue flow, we will leverage the morphoelasticity theory and develop novel numerical methods which solve the coupled system of nonlinear elliptic and time-evolution equations by constrained nonlinear optimizations.

Although posttraumatic anosmia has been documented in the medical literature for more than a century, neither the underlying mechanisms nor treatment remain clear. Moreover, the occurrence of traumatic brain injury significantly increases risk for the development of Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease) or non-Alzheimer's disease forms of dementia. Recent studies of olfactory deficits have focused its potential as an early biomarker for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders and their disease progression. Thus, traumatic brain injury survivors with olfactory deficits may be an early sign heralding its progression to dementia. Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis revealed that the peripheral olfactory pathways including the olfactory bulb (olfactory bulb) are the potential structural candidates responsible for olfactory deficits in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Emerging studies have associated olfactory deficits with the presence of olfactory bulb inflammatory response, suggesting that olfactory bulb pathology may provide a mechanistic link between traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Recent data indicate that traumatic brain injury-induced rapid and persistent pro-inflammatory responses in the olfactory bulb were accompanied by increased phosphorylated tau and olfactory bulb atrophy, resulting in early and persistent olfactory deficits. New data indicate that microglia-mediated inflammation contributed to neuronal hyperexcitation in the olfactory bulb which was mitigated in the absence of Hv1, a newly discovered microglial ion channel required for NAlzheimer's diseasePH oxidase-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species. Based on these findings and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that early after traumatic brain injury microglial Hv1-mediated inflammation in the olfactory bulb contributes to hyperexcitation of local neurons leading to olfactory dysfunction, thus heralding its progression to late-onset neurodegeneration. With multidisciplinary approaches including the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREAlzheimer's diseaseD)-based chemogenetic inhibition of olfactory bulb microglia, microglia-specific and inducible Hv1 KO mice combined with microscopy and biochemical approaches, and comprehensive neurobehavioral testing, we will examine neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the olfactory bulb in a well-established controlled cortical impact mouse traumatic brain injury model and their correlation with olfactory deficits and late-onset dementia-like behaviors (AIM 1). Furthermore, powerful in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological approaches will be applied to characterize detrimental effects of traumatic brain injury-induced inflammation on network and synaptic functions in the olfactory bulb (AIM 2). Lastly, we will determine whether genetic or pharmacological inhibition of inflammatory pathways in the olfactory bulb through intranasal delivery mitigates traumatic brain injury-induced inflammation and neurodegeneration thus improves functional outcomes (AIM 3). Our study will be the first to link olfactory dysfunction to dementia and neurodegeneration following traumatic brain injury. Our findings will potentially shed light on developing effective approaches for early and accurate diagnosis of traumatic brain injury-associated olfactory deficits in the development of neurodegeneration and dementia.",5,5R01AG077541-03,PAR-19-070,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,2,6,6,1

NIH MIRA project summary abstract Title: Chemical labeling strategies using biomolecule-compatible, nonaqueous media Abstract: Among many classes of chemical tools devised to date, protein bioconjugation technologies have proven valuable in a wide variety of contexts such as preparation of therapeutic agents and study of disease mechanism The last decade has witnessed a substantial advance in bioconjugation technologies, although challenges of selective and efficient labeling have not been completely addressed to date for many of the 20 canonical amino acids. Our research program tackles the longstanding issues of selective bioconjugation of unactivated amino acids by identifying nonaqueous media suitable for both biomolecules and organic chemistry reactions, which has not been actively pursued to date and is innovative from the applicant's point of view. Our long-term goal is to develop bioconjugation methods selectively targeting amino acids that were inaccessible by previous approaches in aqueous media. Our overall objective in this application is to discover chemical methods for chemoselective functionalization of hydrophobic, unactivated, and less abundant amino acids, offering higher chance of site-specific modification due to their lower natural abundance and less surface exposure. Our central hypothesis is that nonaqueous media can be compatible with proteins and induce chemical reactions that were not achievable in aqueous medium. The rationale for the proposal is that development of novel bioconjugation methods is expected to become facile by gaining access to a large number of synthetic methodology literature that often relies on nonaqueous media. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide a chemical tool to target amino acid residues that were inaccessible by the traditional methods and to provide a new paradigm to create bioconjugates.",1,1R35GM155051-01,PAR-23-145,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

The core phenotype originates from disrupted development of the pharyngeal apparatus. Particularly affected are the second heart field-dependent heart structures, great vessels, parathyroids, thymus, and lower craniofacial and face muscles. Although approximately 50 genes may be deleted, it is the haploinsufficiency of the transcription factor TBX1 that recapitulates most of the critical phenotype associated with 22q11.2DS. Genetic and developmental mouse studies have established that TBX1 is critical for typical development of the pharyngeal endoderm, a transient anatomical structure necessary for development of the thymus, parathyroids, and 4th pharyngeal arch arteries. Despite this central role, very little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms by which TBX1 functions in the pharyngeal endoderm. While a handful of studies have attempted to study the role of TBX1 in human cells, the cell types they have been conducted in are not representative of the appropriate developmental stage where and when TBX1 plays its critical role. To date, an effort to integrate all the critical genes into a pharyngeal endoderm or 4th pharyngeal arch arteries network has not been attempted, particularly in human cells. This R01 leverages recent development of an in vitro model which faithfully mimics the formation and progression of human pharyngeal endoderm, thereby providing an unprecedented opportunity to tease out the functions of TBX1 in its physiological context. Specifically, this model will be used to identify the transcriptional targets and partners of TBX1 (Aim1), investigate the role of TBX1 as epigenetic regulator of the human pharyngeal endoderm (Aim2), and mechanistically investigate newly discovered putative regulatory regions of the TBX1 locus (Aim3). The overarching hypothesis is that TBX1 is at the center of a Gene Regulatory Network critical for both the formation and maturation of the pharyngeal endoderm and the morpho-patterning of the surrounding mesoderm and neural crest cells. The proposed work is expected to identify the molecular mechanism at the basis of TBX1 haploinsufficiency and identify pathways which could be rescued through pharmacological intervention. Dissection of the epigenetic and molecular machinery responsible for pharyngeal endoderm formation will be instrumental in informing the generation of cell therapies for 22q11.2DS.",5,5R01HL157139-03,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",15,7,2,0

Most patients have a 3 Mb deletion on one copy of chromosome 22q11.2, resulting in a haploinsufficiency of over 107 genes, 46 protein coding and the remainder noncoding RNAs and pseudogenes. Children born with this deletion can have a range of congenital anomalies that often include three that are developmentally linked; hypoplasia of the thymus, congenital heart defects (congenital heart defects), and hypoparathyroidism. Approximately 60-70% of the patients have an immunodeficiency due to reduced T cell output from a hypoplastic thymus and are often clinically referred to as having DiGeorge syndrome. The underlying mechanisms causing the defective formation/patterning of the thymic tissue remains poorly understood. Our results, obtained during the previous cycle of this grant, suggest a defect among the neural crest derived mesenchymal cells, which form the thymic capsule and vasculature and regulate the expansion of the thymus. In our first aim, the developmental abnormalities of the pharyngeal apparatus leading to the formation of a hypoplastic thymus will be determined. Specifically, the role of the neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells in regulating the development and expansion of the thymus will be studied. Embryonic thymii from mouse models of 22q11.2del will be used in reaggregate fetal thymic organ cultures to define the role of mesenchymal cells in the process of thymus expansion. RNA sequencing approaches, including single cell RNA sequencing will be used to determine what mesenchymal transcripts are involved in this process. These experiments will be complemented with a characterization of human thymii from 22q11.2del patients and normal controls. In humans with 22q11.2del along with the mouse models, there is a post-natal miRNA dysregulation noted. In aim 2, we will explore the consequence of these miRNA changes using a combination of longitudinal studies in humans and diverse mouse models. This will reveal whether the dysregulation of miRNAs impacts immune functions pertaining to the thymus. Results from the two aims will enable us to develop better strategies for restoring thymus functions in various clinical settings resulting in the hypoplasia of this tissue.",5,5R01AI114523-10,PAR-18-712,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,11,7,2,0

Thus, targeted approaches detailing specific brain dysfunction in 22q11DS may elucidate critical neural mechanisms in psychosis. Specifically, approaches that capture abnormalities common to individuals at-risk for psychosis and with a genetic risk to psychosis, such as 22q11DS, may help explain risk and resilience for psychosis. Minor physical anomalies (Minor physical anomalies) are phenotypic abnormalities of aberrant development. Minor physical anomalies include subtle abnormalities of morphological structures encompassing numerous body parts including eyes, ears, mouth and head. Abnormalities of the face and head likely represent a disruption of early embryologic development, including the olfactory system and facial morphology, making these promising entry points for understanding neurodevelopmental neuropathology associated with 22q11DS and psychosis In this study, we seek to compare 1) measures of olfactory function; 2) structural abnormalities of the olfactory system and 3) structural abnormalities of the face in a large cohort of patients with 22q11DS (n=100), including those with and without psychosis, to typically developing (typically developing) individual. Finally, we will employ machine learning algorithms to select features that best differentiate 22q11DS+ from 22q11DSand use those features to classify individual with idiopathic risk for psychosis (psychosis). In addition, analyses will leverage recent advances in machine learning to predict salient features associated with dimensional measures of psychosis. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis.",5,5R01MH119185-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,11,8,6,1

They contain numerous regulatory elements that are poorly characterized, making them a core target for posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNAs and RNA binding proteins. MiRNAs are small regulatory RNAs that bind 3'UTRs and repress mRNA translation. Our group and others have shown that alternative polyadenylation (alternative polyadenylation), an elusive process observed in metazoans that gives rise to genes with various 3'UTR isoforms, is widespread. While alternative polyadenylation is frequently present in normal states and in virtually all diseases, its biological role in cells and tissues is a mystery. Genes with longer 3'UTRs have more potential regulatory sites, thus alternative polyadenylation may allow genes to alter their 3'UTR length and escape the repression by miRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Since alternative polyadenylation is abundant this could explain why there is not a direct correlation between cellular transcriptomes and proteomes. Understanding the global mechanics of 3'end formation, alternative polyadenylation function, and miRNA targeting would advance research on post-transcriptional modifications. Metazoans possess hundreds of miRNAs and thousands of 3'UTR isoforms, most of which are expressed and function in different tissues and developmental contexts. We know little about how these networks operate and communicate with each other, despite their critical role in controlling gene expression. We need to gain new data and insights, and develop a high-resolution miRNAs/3'UTRs Interactome by acquiring and fusing tissuespecific miRNA localization data, miRNA target data, and 3'UTRs isoform data. Our Interactome will provide the global basis of post-transcriptional gene regulation function in vivo, elucidating its role in both normal and disease states in metazoans. In our first R01 grant we studied tissue-specific alternative polyadenylation events and miRNA networks in the nematode C. elegans, to define and probe the worm miRNAs/3'UTRs Interactome. We identified 3'UTR isoforms in eight C. elegans somatic tissues, acquired miRNA expression data for the three largest and disease-relevant C. elegans worm tissues, developed and implemented unbiased methods to map miRNA targets in high throughput, and initiated mechanistic studies of alternative polyadenylation selection in genes identified in our studies. For this new submission we will,  complete the worm 3'UTRome by including new tissue-specific 3'UTR isoforms,  identify tissue-specific miRNA populations in eight worm somatic tissues and,  perform mechanistic studies to determine tissue-specific PAS choice in the context of alternative polyadenylation. Our curated 3'UTRome will be the first database to provide a complete metazoan 3'UTRome mapped at a single base resolution. Investigating three global hypotheses of PAS choice can uncover global post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms implicated in tissue development and disease, and therefore of high impact. We believe that the impact of these new studies is high since will provide important results toward a global understanding the biology of post-transcriptional gene regulation in metazoans. 1",5,5R01GM118796-09,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,10,10,2,0

Published data show that 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine therapy has a rapid onset and a ability to foster feelings of social connection, empathy and trust. However, 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine itself may not be an ideal therapeutic, as it has a well-known potential for abuse and is associated with cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric toxicity. Despite these and other limitations, the apparent efficacy of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine suggests that directly enhancing sociability and social reward sensitivity are feasible, potentially powerful therapeutic strategies. In mouse models we can use 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine as a unique probe to understand evolutionarily conserved social behaviors with potential therapeutic relevance. Conventional approaches to understanding the mechanism of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine and other psychiatric drugs, focusing on high affinity receptor interactions and select brain areas, have had limited success at developing novel therapeutics for psychiatric disease. My lab has developed a way to define with few assumptions about pharmacology or brain areas involved. This method, in mice, maps brain-wide activity evoked du for 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine-linked behaviors. Combining social behavioral testing and imaging could be used to screen novel therapeutics for 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine-like profiles and provides testable hypotheses for human imaging studies with 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine releases supraphysiological levels of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (dopamine) among other neuromodulators and evokes acute social preference, social reward learning, and nonsocial drug reward in humans and mice. Mechanistically similar drugs that primarily release 5-HT (d-fenfluramine, FEN) or dopamine (dmethamphetamine, METH) recapitulate selective components of the total 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine effect, but neither induces social reward learning. Here, we propose to take advantage of the overlapping yet distinct behavioral and unique prosocial effects. First, we compare brain-wide Fos expression maps between groups of mice under drug/environmental conditions that on brain-wide neural activity -like behavioral effects. Second, we test whether activity in identified regions is required for expression of four 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine-evoked behaviors: acute social preference, drug craving, social reward craving and social operant conditioning. My preliminary data demonstrates proof-of-concept: we have discovered that the dorsal endopiriform nucleus/ ventral claustrum (dorsal endopiriform nucleus/ ventral claustrum) has an obligate role in 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine-evoked acute social preference. Third, we detail the anatomy and connectivity of the dorsal endopiriform nucleus/ ventral claustrum, and test whether its activity can suffice to drive prosocial behaviors.",5,5R01MH130591-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,8,1

The main goals of this Project are to utilize functional precision medicine techniques to better understand biological vulnerabilities in Richter's cells and to identify novel pharmacologic interventions to increase apoptotic signaling in these cells. Our priority is on the direct study of viable samples from Richter's Syndrome patients obtained in collaboration with the Biospecimens core. We seek to identify the most promising combinations to subsequently explore in early phase clinical trials for patients with Richter's Syndrome, funded by other mechanisms. The job of precision medicine is to match the right patient to the right drug. A strategy of genomic sequencing has yielded several successes, such as treating EGFR mutant lung cancer with EGFR inhibitors; however, to date Richter's Syndrome has not yielded to the identification of targetable genetic abnormalities, and this will be the focus of Project 1. In Project 3, we propose an alternative approach, which we call functional precision medicine. Rather than rely on static -omic data, we propose to perturb cellular function in ways that allow us to identify active drugs. Central to this strategy is BH3 profiling, a technique in which we expose mitochondria from living cells to synthetic BH3 peptides and measure mitochondrial permeabilization. From this assay we can learn which antiapoptotic proteins the cell relies on for survival, whether BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, some combination thereof, or none of these proteins. This information has direct translational application, as clinical BH3 mimetic inhibitors of all three listed proteins now exist. In fact, BH3 profiling was used to direct therapy of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax to CLL and AML, two indications for which venetoclax has now received FDA approval. We propose to use BH3 profiling to identify which BH3 mimetic(s) would be most active in Richter's Syndrome. BH3 profiling can also provide a summary measure of how close a cell is to the threshold of apoptosis. When coupled with a brief preceding drug exposure, dynamic BH3 profiling (dynamic BH3 profiling) can identify drugs from any class that induce apoptotic signaling in cancer cells, moving them closer to the threshold of apoptosis. We have previously demonstrated in several liquid and solid tumor contexts that this strategy accurately identifies drugs with in vivo activity for individual tumors, and can predict clinical response in patients. We propose to use dynamic BH3 profiling to identify active drugs, after which we will explore their use in combination with each other and with the appropriate BH3 mimetics identified above. As we identify drug vulnerabilities for the panel of Richter's Syndrome samples to be studied in this Project, we will compare them with clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic annotations prepared by other Projects and Cores in this P01. We hope to use this information to gain insight into the upstream signaling mechanisms that drive drug-induced apoptotic signaling.",5,5P01CA206978-09,PAR-20-077,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,16,0,4,4

One major mechanism contributing to increased cardiovascular risk in this patient population is chronic over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system (sympathetic nervous system). sympathetic nervous system overactivity in chronic kidney disease leads to difficult-to-control blood pressure (blood pressure), and an abnormal circadian rhythm of blood pressure characterized by failure to decrease blood pressure at night (i.e. nondipping), that is independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Current strategies to combat sympathetic nervous system overactivation, however, are limited to sympatholytic medications that are often poorly tolerated with adverse side effects. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop novel, safe, and well-tolerated strategies for reducing sympathetic nervous system activity to improve clinical cardiovascular outcomes in this highly prevalent and growing population of chronic kidney disease patients. One such novel approach at improving hemodynamics and autonomic function in chronic kidney disease is mindfulness meditation (mindfulness meditation). Multiple prior studies have shown that mindfulness meditation, and specifically mindfulness-based stress reduction (mindfulness-based stress reduction), significantly reduces blood pressure in a variety of patient populations. However, the mechanisms underlying the blood pressure-lowering effect of mindfulness meditation are unclear. Small studies using indirect measures have suggested that mindfulness meditation may modulate the autonomic nervous system; however, no prior studies have used direct, gold-standard methods to interrogate the sustained effects of mindfulness meditation-based interventions on sympathetic nervous system. We performed the first studies using direct, intraneural measurements of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (muscle sympathetic nerve activity) that demonstrate that mindfulness meditation acutely reduces blood pressure and muscle sympathetic nerve activity in chronic kidney disease. In Aim1 (R61), we will test the hypothesis that 8 weeks of mindfulness-based stress reduction leads to sustained reductions in muscle sympathetic nerve activity that are linked to improvements in daytime blood pressure, and improved nocturnal dipping of blood pressure in chronic kidney disease. Following these studies, we will determine if transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation), a simple, noninvasive, self-administered adjunctive therapy, enhances the sympatho-inhibitory effects of mindfulness meditation in chronic kidney disease. The vagus nerve, the major effector of the parasympathetic nervous system (parasympathetic nervous system), is comprised of afferent nerve fibers that connect to the nucleus tractus solitarii (nucleus tractus solitarii) and other brainstem regions that influence central sympathetic nervous system output and baroreflexes, and efferent nerve fibers that activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Both experimental and human studies have demonstrated that transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation reduces sympathetic nervous system activity, improves baroreflex sensitivity (baroreflex sensitivity), and lowers inflammation, and our preliminary data demonstrate that transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation reduces muscle sympathetic nerve activity and improves baroreflex sensitivity in chronic kidney disease. In Aim 2 (R33), we will test the hypothesis that transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation augments the beneficial effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on muscle sympathetic nerve activity and ambulatory blood pressure profiles, and ameliorates sympathetic nervous system overactivation by improving arterial baroreflex sensitivity and reducing inflammation in chronic kidney disease. These studies will elucidate autonomic mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of mindfulness meditation in chronic kidney disease, while addressing a critical need for the development of safe, well-tolerated and effective treatment approaches to ameliorating sympathetic nervous system overactivity, reducing blood pressure and improving cardiovascular risk profiles in patient with chronic kidney disease.",5,5R33AT010457-05,PAR-18-114,NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY & INTEGRATIVE HEALTH,8,2,0,1

Cancer survivors from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds experience a higher prevalence of insomnia (vs. nonHispanic white cancer survivors) yet are underrepresented in cancer survivorship research and sleep clinical trials. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia) is a first line, evidence-based treatment. Meta-analyses by our group and others have found medium effect size improvements on insomnia, yet barriers to feasibility due to current delivery modalities and lack of targeted content addressing cancer-related barriers to sleep hinder retention. Our study team developed a synchronous, virtual Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia for cancer survivors with 4 weekly sessions delivered to individuals (Survivorship Sleep Program; SSP) and conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial demonstrating feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy vs. enhanced usual care up to 1-month postintervention. However, participants desired enhanced emotional support via a group format or booster sessions, and additional outcomes (emotional distress, work-related functioning, use of sleep medications) were unchanged or not assessed. In response to PAR-21-341, the primary aim of this resubmission is to optimize synchronous, virtual delivery of the SSP in a 2x2 factorial trial (N=80 cancer survivors with insomnia) to evaluate 2 intervention design components: delivery (individual vs. group) and booster sessions (0 vs. 3). The primary outcome is change in insomnia severity from baseline (T0) to 1-month surveillance/booster 1 (T2). Exploratory Aim 1 will characterize study participation and sleep outcomes by race and by ethnicity. Feasibility benchmarks established in our previous pilot trial for enrollment (56% enrolled/eligible), retention (90% per timepoint), and attendance (100%) will be examined by race and by ethnicity. Primary and secondary (emotional distress, work-related functioning, use of sleep medications, sleep diaries, actigraphy) outcomes across timepoints (T0-T3; 3-months surveillance/booster 3) will be explored by race and by ethnicity. Exploratory Aim 2 will characterize the acceptability of the SSP design components via exit interviews assessed post-SSP (T1) using quantitative ratings and qualitative codes to characterize preferences, challenges, and future delivery considerations. Collectively, this proposal is innovative through its focus on 1) optimizing Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia for cancer survivors, 2) testing a scalable, virtually-delivered synchronous intervention, 3) including key secondary outcomes relevant to cancer survivorship, and 4) engaging community partners to bolster recruitment of racially and ethnically diverse cancer survivors.

Our prior work has demonstrated that this augmented pressor response in chronic kidney disease is due to exaggerated increases in reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system (sympathetic nervous system) during exercise that is mediated by muscle afferent nerve activation, referred to as the exercise pressor reflex. Importantly, such heightened sympathetic nervous system and pressor responses contribute to increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including sudden death, during physical activity, as well as exercise intolerance that has a profound negative impact on quality of life. While we now know that exaggerated muscle afferent nerve activation underlies the exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in chronic kidney disease, the mechanisms that mediate heightened muscle afferent nerve activation to induce heightened blood pressure reactivity remain unknown. Elucidating mechanisms of augmented exercise pressor reflex is critical for revealing new treatment targets to improve cardiovascular risk and physical functioning in this highly prevalent, high-risk patient population. We have compelling preliminary evidence that muscle interstitial acidosis plays a major role in activating muscle afferent nerves, leading to an exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in chronic kidney disease. During exercise, ischemic metabolites including H+ accumulate in the muscle interstitium and activate receptors on muscle afferent nerve endings to induce reflex increases in sympathetic nervous system activation. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) is the major buffer preventing excessive reductions in muscle interstitial pH during exercise; however, chronic kidney disease patients have decreased HCO3bioavailability starting at chronic kidney disease Stage IIIB due to an impaired ability of the diseased kidneys to excrete the daily acid load, resulting in decreased buffering capacity. Our central hypothesis is that muscle interstitial acidosis resulting from decreased muscle buffering capacity augments the exercise pressor reflex in chronic kidney disease. We will test this hypothesis using direct microneurographic recording of sympathetic nervous system activity, hemodynamics, biomarkers and innovative imaging techniques at rest and during exercise in chronic kidney disease patients. We will also determine if acute restoration of HCO3bioavailability ameliorates exercise-induced hypertension in chronic kidney disease, and whether oral bicarbonate supplementation enhances the beneficial effects of exercise training in chronic kidney disease. Current treatment guidelines recommend bicarbonate therapy only in chronic kidney disease patients with overt acidosis ([HCO3-] ≤21 mmol/L); however, bicarbonate may be a simple, safe and innovative method to target muscle afferent nerve activation and improve exercise hemodynamics and function in chronic kidney disease patients even without overt resting acidosis. Thus, these studies have high potential to impact clinical practice regarding serum [HCO3-] goals, indications for bicarbonate therapy and renal rehabilitation strategies to improve long-term cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease.",5,5R01HL135183-08,PA-20-183,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,2,0,0

Altered neuronal metabolism, neuronal activity, and neurodegeneration are key features in both alcohol use disorder (alcohol use disorder) and Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease). alcohol use disorder and Alzheimer's disease are linked, with alcohol related brain damage (alcohol related brain damage) being one of the strongest risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanisms underlying altered neuronal metabolism in these diseases, and its impacts on neuronal activity and neurodegeneration are unknown. We reported that proinflammatory microglia promote alcohol related brain damage and alcohol-enhancement of Alzheimer's disease pathology. We now find that microglia promote lipid accumulation in neurons with alcohol. Therefore, we hypothesize that alcohol alters neuronal activity and survival to promote alcohol use disorder and Alzheimer's disease through a novel microglianeuronal metabolic link. In alcohol use disorder and Alzheimer's disease, brain glucose metabolism is reduced. alcohol related brain damage correlates with this reduction, suggesting metabolic changes promote pathology. Recent studies suggest microglia may also contribute. Proinflammatory microglia undergo a glycolytic burst that can produce high levels of lactate and express the lactate exporter MCT4. We hypothesize that the proinflammatory microglia induced by alcohol deliver excess lactate to neurons, causing a metabolic imbalance that alters neuronal activity and promotes neurodegeneration. Alcohol (i.e. ethanol) is metabolized by oxidative and non-oxidative pathways (OME and NOME) to produce acetate and fatty-acid ethyl esters (fatty-acid ethyl esters) respectively. Acetate is converted to lipids through acetyl-coA. Microglia, but not neurons, have OME machinery. Thus, we hypothesize microglial OME releases acetate to disrupt neuronal lipid metabolism. We recently found that accumulation of neuronal lipids caused by alcohol promotes Alzheimer's disease pathology. Amyloid-β (Amyloid-β) is normally degraded within neurons by lysosomes. Ethanol increased neuronal lysosomal lipid to cause lysosomal damage and prevent neuronal degradation of intraneuronal Amyloid-β. Inhibition of proinflammatory microglia prevented neuronal lipidosis, identifying microglia as regulators of Alzheimer's disease-promoting changes in neuronal metabolism. However, the mechanism underlying this microglianeuronal link in Alzheimer's disease are unknown. Given the impact of ethanol on microglial activation, and consequences of ethanol metabolism, we hypothesize energetic metabolites produced by microglial glycolysis as well as microglial ethanol metabolism combine to produce neuronal lipidosis, lysosomal dysfunction, altered neuronal activity, and neurodegeneration associated with alcohol use disorder and Alzheimer's disease. We propose to employ novel human 3D reciprocal brain circuits (human 3D reciprocal brain circuits) to test the role of microglia in neuronal metabolism and activity (Aim 1-2), alcohol-induced neurotoxicity (Aim 1) and Amyloid-β accumulation (Aim 2). These reciprocal circuits are formed using human IPSCderived neurons grown in proprietary microfluidic culture platforms (XonaTM) that enable the bidirectional growth of axons between two distinct compartments and mimics the three dimensional and multi-cellular features found in vivo; it also reproduces the dynamics caused by both outgoing projections and inputs from other brain regions.",1,1R21AA031414-01A1,PAR-23-047,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM,2,6,6,1

However, the concept of HPV integration is not routinely used in clinical practice. Intriguingly, we and others have shown that at least 25% of HPV-positive (HPV-positive) cancers harbor only ""extrachromosomal"" HPV (""eHPV""), and there are reports of ""hybrid"" tumors with both eHPV and iHPV. We have also shown that there is no difference in the distribution of clinical stage between patients with eHPV versus iHPV tumors, even though patients with eHPV tumors have better clinical outcomes. Based on this, we posit that eHPV and iHPV tumors have distinct molecular drivers and may require different treatment strategies. Investigation of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in cervical cancer remains highly significant despite the advances in screening and vaccination. The successes of these prevention programs in the ""West"" have not been replicated in resource-poor countries with the greatest disease burden, and even in the United States, disparities in vaccine uptake still exist with millions still at risk of developing cervical cancer. We were the first to discover r ecurrent somatic ERK2-E322K mutations in primary cancers (8% o f cervical cancer). We have now shown that ERK2-E322K mutations are 9 times mo re likely to occur in eHPV tumors compared with iHPV tumors. We have also identified specific viral spliced transcripts (viral spliced transcripts) that distinguish eHPV and iHPV primary HPV16-positive cervical tumors, and we have shown using viral spliced transcripts that the expression of HPV E5, which is known to promote angiogenesis, is a hallmark of eHPV status. Our overall hypotheses are that eHPV-tumors and iHPV-tumors have distinct host and viral genomic classification markers, that patients with eHPV tumors respond better to therapy with the angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab than those with iHPV tumors, and that ERK2-E322K mutation enhances the growth of eHPV tumors more than iHPV tumors. Our specific aims to: (i) characterize host molecular markers that distinguish eHPV-tumors from iHPV-tumors, (ii) investigate the diagnostic and therapeutic utility of HPV viral spliced transcripts in cervical cancer, and (iii) investigate the effect of ERK2E322K mutation on the growth of eHPV versus iHPV tumors.

The syndrome is associated with an astonishing 40-fold increased risk for schizophrenia, as well as cognitive disability, a high rate of autism and social disability, executive function deficits and pronounced prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), clinically significant graphomotor weakness, and manifestation of anxiety disorders. The factors that contribute to this phenotypic heterogeneity are not understood. We propose to evaluate 200 individuals with the 3q29 deletion, to better define phenotypic manifestations and identify risk modifiers for key phenotypes. In particular, we seek to understand how polygenic background and sex of the proband may modify risk for psychosis, cognitive disability, social functioning, and other phenotypes. To facilitate our evaluation and attenuate ascertainment bias, we have developed a remote phenotyping battery, which does not require travel to a testing site. This remote battery removes barriers to participation for our study subjects and dramatically reduces costs, improving the efficiency of our study. Using this validated phenotyping protocol, we will characterize 200 new study subjects with the 3q29 deletion, and identify the full phenotypic spectrum, sex-dependent phenotypic risks and significant comorbid relationships. We will also phenotype biological parents to contextualize the burden of illness in 3q29 deletion syndrome relative to departure from mid-parental phenotype, and clarify the range of phenotypic heterogeneity in 3q29 deletion syndrome. We will collect DNA from our study subjects, to directly test the contribution of polygenic risk to selected phenotypes. Finally, in a collaboration with the NIMH-sponsored Genes 2 Mental Health Network, we will compare the phenotypic spectrum and risk modifiers of 3q29 deletion syndrome with >2,000 samples from other genomic disorders associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including 22q11.2 deletion and duplication, 16p11 deletion and duplication, 1q21 deletion, and others. At the end of this project, we will have a comprehensive survey of 3q29 deletion associated phenotypes, an understanding of how sex and polygenic background may increase or attenuate phenotypic risks in 3q29 deletion syndrome, and an appreciation for how the 3q29 deletion compares to the broader landscape of rare genetic disorders associated with developmental brain disorders.

A quarter of people living with HIV remain untested, depriving them of opportunities to enter the HIV prevention continuum and access evidence based prevention tools. Testing is particularly low in gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (men who have sex with men) who face additional discrimination on account of their same sex behaviors. Stigma can be internalized or anticipated but it is most pernicious when it is enacted in healthcare settings, as this directly bars care access while also discouraging future care seeking. Enacted healthcare stigma is notoriously difficult to measure, as few providers willingly report discriminatory behavior and patients lack the medical knowledge to assess the appropriateness of care. Our solution is to conduct unannounced standardized patient (standardized patient) visits to measure and address enacted healthcare stigma. standardized patients are actors hired from the local community and trained to present standardized, unannounced disease cases in area clinics for the purposes of evaluation and feedback. Their ability to objectively document provider behaviors through unannounced visits presents an elegant solution to the common tendency of providers to alter behaviors under observation. By randomly varying the sexual orientation and HIV status of presented cases, our technique obtains discrete measures of HIV, sexual, and intersectional stigma. Results of an initial round of standardized patient visits are shared with advisory boards of providers and men who have sex with men to solicit their views on stigma drivers which inform a tailored stigma reduction training for study providers which is then evaluated in a second round of visits. Our team has conducted an NIH-funded pilot randomized control trial (randomized control trial) in southern China that demonstrated high feasibility and acceptability of the standardized patient approach for measuring and reducing stigma (R34MH121251). This R01 application follows on the success of the R34 to propose a fully powered cluster randomized control trial using tools, lessons, and experience gained form our pilot. This trial will newly include rural clinics to expand generalizability and will also explore future implementation potential of our intervention with regional policy makers. Our interdisciplinary team combines expertise in HIV prevention, stigma, LGBT health, standardized patient research, and medical education to investigate the following aims: 1) Conduct a baseline round of standardized patient visits to inform the design of a standardized patient-informed stigma reduction intervention with support from men who have sex with men and provider community advisory boards; 2) implement the intervention in treatment arm clinics and evaluate its impact on enacted stigma and clinic-level HIV testing volume and 3) conduct qualitative interviews with stakeholders (providers, men who have sex with men, health officials) to help inform the design of a Implementation Blueprint to guide potential future adopters in assessing its suitability and their team readiness to implement a standardized patient-informed stigma intervention in their setting.",1,1R01MH136900-01,PAR-23-062,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,6,5,3,2

Obesity produces type II diabetes, which increases the risk for cardiovascular disease, many cancers, and Alzheimer's. The NIH strategic plan for obesity research provides ""a blueprint (to) encourage the research community to examine the epidemic of obesity from diverse perspectives...in order to develop and evaluate new prevention and treatment strategies"". Further, the NIDDK Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience of Obesity Program was formed to promote studies of ""non-homeostatic brain-behavior mechanisms (to prevent) obesity"". This proposal directly addresses these needs by using novel approaches to understand differences in neural function and behavior in preclinical obesity models. In people, exposure to cues associated with food (food cues), like the smell of brownies or a blinking donuts sign, increases food craving and the amount of food consumed. Obese people report stronger craving and eat larger portions in response to food cues. Further, increases in activity of the nucleus accumbens (nucleus accumbens) triggered by food cues predict future weight gain inability to lose weight. Thus in people, enhanced neurobehavioral responses to food cues contribute to obesity. But, the mechanism underlying this enhanced neurobehavioral reactivity is unknown. Our long-term goal is to understand the neurobehavioral mechanisms that underlie enhanced cue-triggered `cravings' that contribute to obesity. AMPA type glutamate receptors (AMPA type glutamate receptors) provide the main source of excitation to the nucleus accumbens, and nucleus accumbens activity is required for cue-triggered motivation in non-obese rats. My lab has found that that cue-triggered food-seeking is stronger in obesity-susceptible males and females prior to obesity and that consumption of a sugary, fatty `junk-food' diet enhances excitatory transmission within the nucleus accumbens. Our objectives here are to determine the role of nucleus accumbens glutamatergic plasticity in cue-triggered food-seeking after junkfood exposure, and the degree to which junk-food-induced glutamate plasticity occurs in specific circuits and nucleus accumbens cell types. These studies address significant gaps in our current understanding of diet-induced plasticity that drives obesity. Our studies will provide key insights into the neural basis of cue-triggered motivation and help delineate behavioral processes and specific circuits involved in both sexes, and as a function of obesitysusceptibility. Eating is often initiated by food cues and eating in response to food cues contributes to human obesity. Thus, this work inform treatment by providing a better understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of cue-triggered motivation in relevant preclinical models.",5,5R01DK130246-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,1,3,8,2

The high failure rates of rotator cuff tear after surgical repair or non-surgical treatment make it a major clinical challenge. The outcome failures accompany the formation of scar tissues at the tendon-to-bone insertion (tendon enthesis) with disorganized architecture and deteriorated function. Development of effective therapeutics has been hampered by limited knowledge of enthesis development biology and mechanobiology and an incomplete understanding of endogenous mechanisms governing enthesis pathogenesis and healing. To bridge this knowledge gap, the current proposal seeks to elucidate how tendon enthesis responds to its mechanical and biochemical environment during development and healing processes. It is known that a combination of mechanical force and distinct pathways, including hedgehog (hedgehog) signaling, drive enthesis formation, promote remodeling of mature enthesis, and affect enthesis healing. Recently, our studies have indicated that the primary cilium, a solitary antenna protruding from mammalian cell surface, potentially functions as a hub for mechanotransduction and hedgehog signaling. Building on our previous work, the objective of this proposal is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the role of primary cilia in concentrating and synchronizing mechanical and hedgehog signals during enthesis development and healing. To achieve this objective, we will determine identities and activities of ciliated enthesis cells during enthesis development and mechanical adaptation (Specific Aim 1) and evaluate the regenerative capacity of ciliated enthesis cells for improving enthesis healing (Specific Aim 2). The approaches we will use include cilia-labeled and cilia-deleted transgenic mouse models, different established loading models, cell transplantation, and transcriptomics analysis, combined with structural, compositional, and biomechanical evaluation assays. At the conclusion of this project, we expect to identify new cilia-regulated mechanotransduction pathways during in vivo enthesis mechanical adaptation and suggest novel mechanisms by which cilia convert mechanical cues to cellular signaling events. The new findings of the role of primary cilia in enthesis healing will guide the development of novel pharmacological and mechanobiology therapeutics for treating rotator cuff tears.",5,5R01AR082797-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASES,15,2,0,0

In the US alone, the annual health care costs for people with Alzheimer's disease will exceed 1 trillion dollars by 2050. However, current treatments do not robustly prevent disease progression. The major risk factors for the late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease are advanced age and possession of the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (apolipoprotein E). Importantly, increasing data support the hypothesis that latent herpes simplex virus 1 (herpes simplex virus 1) infection is also a risk factor, especially in combination with the apolipoprotein E4 allele. This suggests that current antivirals may halt or delay neurodegenerative disease progression in apolipoprotein E4 carriers who are infected with herpes simplex virus 1. A major gap in the study of this association, however, is the absence of an HSV infection model reflecting the complexity of long-term latent infection, particularly in the context of apolipoprotein E4 and Alzheimer's disease. In our preliminary studies, we observed that herpes simplex virus 1-infected apolipoprotein E4 mice, compared to mock-infected apolipoprotein E4 mice and herpes simplex virus 1-infected WT mice, displayed robust spatial memory deficits, as well as oxidative stress, iron dysregulation, and gliosis in the CNS when assessed 15 months post infection (months post infection), but not at 3 months post infection. The objective of this proposal is to use this model, as well as complementary in vitro models, to fully elucidate the effects of long-term latent herpes simplex virus 1 infection, in the context of differential apolipoprotein E isoform expression, on brain function and Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. We will also assess whether treatment with a novel, brain-penetrant antiviral medication can block these effects.

While transthoracic echocardiography-based 4D strain imaging overcomes many shortcomings of traditional strain analysis, and modern speckle-tracking algorithms enhanced reproducibility, 4D echocardiography currently lacks the necessary spatial and temporal resolution for comprehensive flow analysis. Likewise, modern systems do not still allow the user to adjust the number and location of the acquired planes, which is crucial for assessing heart valves and cardiac fluid dynamics enabled by echocardiographic particle image velocimetry (echocardiographic particle image velocimetry).

An upward trajectory has occurred in the last few decades, implicating diet, lifestyle, environment, and improved diagnostics. The contributions of diet to this increased incidence have been attributed to the excessive consumption of ultraprocessed foods that drive systemic inflammation. Just as poor dietary habits can compromise health, diseases can potentially be treated or prevented by diets that promote and restore metabolic homeostasis. Consistent with this notion, we have demonstrated that a well-formulated ketogenic diet (ketogenic diet), containing medium chain triglycerides as the primary source of fat, can mitigate the visual and motor deficits in a mouse model of autoimmunity called MOG-EAE. This model reconstitutes many of the signature ocular and motor pathologies experienced by patients with Multiple Sclerosis (Multiple Sclerosis) and Neuromyelitis Optica. The goals of this application are:  to identify the immuno-modulatory mechanisms by which a well-formulated ketogenic diet preserves metabolic homeostasis, gut health, and immune tolerance,  to determine if a ketogenic diet can serve as an adjuvant to enhance the vision-sparing capacity of existing Multiple Sclerosis treatments and  to determine if the ketogenic diet can repair damaged nerves by promoting remyelination. Our leading hypothesis is that a well-formulated ketogenic diet promotes immune tolerance and neuroprotection by creating a systemic anti-inflammatory milieu. Specific Aim 1 will identify the mechanisms linking gut integrity and plasma fatty acids to optic neuritis, a painful and often blinding inflammation of the optic nerve experienced by Multiple Sclerosis patients. Specific Aim 2 will determine if the ketogenic diet can enhance the vision-sparing capacity of several current Multiple Sclerosis treatments.

This work combines psychophysical measurements of vision, a novel reporter mouse, gut permeability assays, high resolution lipidomics, adoptive transfer assays, and blood analyses for markers of inflammation and metabolic/cardiovascular status. This work is distinguished from previous studies by comparing the anatomic-specific effects of the ketogenic diet at each of the primary sites of Multiple Sclerosis lesions (optic nerve, spinal cord, and brain). These studies are designed to overcome the serious adverse effects associated with current Multiple Sclerosis treatments by empowering patients with a readily-implementable dietary strategy to prevent or reduce flare ups of optic neuritis and other debilitating sequelae.

The presence of m5C in diverse virus (CHIKVes, whose RNAs undergo many processes including translation, replication, transcription, and virion packaging, provides an attractive starting point for understanding the broader significance of this modification in regulating RNA function. A single dominant m5C site in Sindbis virus (CHIKV allowed us to generate an m5C-null mutant that exhibited cell-type dependent effects on virus (CHIKV replication. The host tRNA methyltransferase (methyltransferase), NSUN2, which is important for host neuronal development and stem cell differentiation, appears to be the ""writer"" required for m5C modification of Sindbis virus (CHIKV.

TET proteins and the 5mC oxidation pathway are known, pivotal actors in embryonic development and disease, yet the mechanisms by which TET-mediated 5mC oxidation is regulated are completely unknown. We recently discovered that the protein SMCHD1 is a potential negative regulator of TET activity. In humans, SMCHD1 depletion activates the DUX4 gene(s) that cause(s) cell toxicity, muscle degeneration, and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy). We hypothesize that one key function of SMCHD1 is to control 5mC oxidase activities and that lack of SMCHD1 leads to an over-activation of TET-mediated epigenetic function, and the activation of DUX4. The objective of this project is to test this hypothesis and obtain a fundamental understanding of how SMCHD1 interacts with and controls TET-mediated epigenetic function in normal embryonic development and disease. In Aim 1, we will use mouse embryonic stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells to determine the basic mechanisms of SMCHD1-regulated TET function in normal development. We will employ SMCHD1-knockout cell and mouse lines and determine how TET protein distribution in the genome is altered; which loci are affected; if the distribution of oxidized 5-methylcytosine bases (5hmC) is specific to SMCHD1 binding sites; which regions of the (zygotic) genome are activated upon SMCHD1 loss; and if there are shared SMCHD1-mediated regulatory pathways between mouse and human pluripotent cells. The results of these experiments will establish the negative regulatory function of SMCHD1 in normal development and set the stage for disease-specific studies in Aim 2. In Aim 2, we will inactivate SMCHD1 in human muscle cells and determine the epigenetic role of SMCHD1 in cell differentiation and disease by determining gene expression changes, chromatin structure, and genome-wide DNA methylation status. We expect that SMCHD1-mediated TET inhibition and regulation of gene expression will be similar in human and mouse cells, and that depleting TET activity in SMCHD1 knockout cells will at least partially reverse the effects of SMCHD1 loss-of-function phenotypes. In Aim 3, we will perform biochemical studies of SMCHD1-TET protein-protein interactions to identify key binding domains, and determine if TET inhibitors can silence DUX4 expression in cell lines lacking functional SMCHD1, and in muscle cells derived from facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy patients. If successful, these data will provide proof of principle that TET inhibitors may have therapeutic benefit for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy patients. Together, the results of this project will generate the first mechanistic, regulatory model of the TETmediated 5mC oxidation pathway in mouse and man, and the role of the novel TET-SMCHD1 axis in normal development and disease.",5,5R01AR079174-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASES,10,10,2,4

Effects of Adolescent Alcohol on Adult Brain Neurocircuitry. Abstract Our studies find adolescent intermittent ethanol (adolescent intermittent ethanol) exposure increases adult risky decisions, disinhibition, behavioral inflexibility, and reduces sensitivity to adult ethanol challenge as well as increasing alcohol drinking, all risk factors for human AUD. Acetylcholine is reduced by adolescent intermittent ethanol and plays a critical role in cortical activation and integration as well as maturation of adolescent neurocircuits that could impact ethanol sensitivity. Although adolescent intermittent ethanol does not change adult ethanol elimination, it does reduce adult ethanol motor-sedative, anxiolytic, PFC immediate early gene (immediate early gene) c-fos, and cortical functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging) responses. We discovered adolescent intermittent ethanol increases adult HMGB1 and its receptors (i.e., Toll-like receptor 4 [TLR4] and receptor for advanced glycation end products [RAGE]) on neurons, and these signals are linked to epigenetic silencing of cholinergic phenotype genes (i.e., ChAT, VAChT, TrkA) and loss of hippocampal neurogenesis, which are examples of adolescent intermittent ethanol-altered neurocircuitry. Low response to ethanol is associated with AUD, and these changes are found in post-mortem human adult AUD brain. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons integrate neurocircuits, and reductions of these neurons may contribute to adolescent intermittent ethanol pathology. We hypothesize adolescent intermittent ethanol HMGB1→TLR4/RAGE epigenetic silencing of cholinergic neurons alters basal forebrain-corticalhippocampal neurocircuitry, leading to reduced ethanol sensitivity and increased alcohol drinking in adulthood. Reductions of adult ChAT+ neurons caused by adolescent intermittent ethanol were initially interpreted as neurodegeneration; however, the surprising discovery that adolescent intermittent ethanol reductions of ChAT+ neurons are reversible by exercise and indomethacin supports HMGB1→TLR4/RAGE→NFκB epigenetic silencing of ChAT within neurons persisting into adulthood. Reversal of neuroimmune ChAT silencing suggests adolescent intermittent ethanol pathology is persistent, but not permanent. However, it is not known if adolescent intermittent ethanol-mediated adolescent-like low adult ethanol sensitivity can be prevented or reversed. This proposal therefore has the following Aims. AIM 1. Test the hypothesis that adolescent intermittent ethanol decreases adult ethanol sensitivity to brain functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging changes, c-fos expression, ethanol response behaviors (ethanol response behaviors), and increases adult alcohol drinking. AIM 2 will extend studies testing the hypothesis that HMGB1→TLR4/RAGE→NFκB signaling reduces basal forebrain ChAT+ cholinergic neurons by reversible epigenetic mechanisms. AIM 3 will test the hypothesis that adolescent ChAT silencing mimics adult adolescent intermittent ethanol lowethanol response and other pathology. AIM 4 will test the hypothesis that anti-inflammatory treatment known to reverse adolescent intermittent ethanol-altered ChAT, neurogenesis, and epigenetic changes, will also recover adolescent intermittent ethanol-altered c-fos, functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging, ethanol low behavioral response sensitivity, and adult ethanol drinking. Identifying molecular mechanisms and key neurocircuits regulating low response to alcohol will contribute to our understanding of adolescent brain development and the mechanisms determining low response to ethanol challenge, a known risk factor for AUD, as well as possibly identifying treatment targets.",5,5U01AA020023-15,RFA-AA-20-003,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM,0,1,8,2

A shortfall in the specialised workforce to deliver radiotherapy has been identified as the most significant barrier to expanding radiotherapy capacity. The current radiotherapy workflow is inefficient requiring several labor intensive processes and takes weeks to months to deliver in low and middle-income countries. The growing demand for cancer treatment means that the ratio of incidence to mortality will continue to worsen without a scalable solution. Artificial intelligence (Artificial intelligence) based software has been developed to automate two components of the radiotherapy planning pathway 1. Delineation of anatomical areas that are at risk of tumour spread and at risk of radiation damage. 2. Definition of the position, size and shape of the radiation beams. Proposed advantages include improved treatment accuracy, as well as a reduction in the time (from weeks to less than a day) and human resources needed to deliver radiotherapy. We propose a non-randomised prospective study to evaluate the quality and economic impact of Artificial intelligence based automated radiotherapy treatment for cervical cancer and head and neck cancers, which are endemic in low and middle-income countries, and for which radiotherapy is the primary curative treatment modality. The sample size of 706 patients (353 for each cancer type) has been calculated based on an estimated 95% treatment plan acceptability rate. Time and cost savings will be analysed as secondary outcome measures to establish the cost and resource impact of automation using the time-driven activity-based costing model. The 48-month study will take place in six public sector cancer hospitals in India (n=2), Jordan (n=1), Malaysia (n=1), and South Africa (n=2) to ensure we include a broad range of patients and the representativeness of the findings will support implementation of the software in low and middle-income countries. If the study objectives are met, the Artificial intelligence based software will be offered as a not-for-profit web service to public sector state hospitals in low and middle-income countries to support expansion of high quality radiotherapy capacity, improving access, and affordability of this key modality of cancer cure and control.",5,5U01CA269143-02,RFA-CA-21-030,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,17,8,4,4

Many patients may be initially resuscitated from the arrest but go on to die later in the hospital or to have a poor neurologic outcome from cerebral ischemia. The primary medication used during cardiac arrest care, epinephrine, has been proven to improve the chance that the heart will restart, but there is developing evidence that it makes neurologic outcomes worse due to vasoconstriction in the cerebral vasculature. New therapies that can improve blood flow to the heart and to the brain during CPR, and then maintain that increased perfusion after the heart restarts, are needed. This study will test a new endovascular therapy that can augment perfusion to the heart and brain and to decrease epinephrine requirements after the heart has restarted. Endovascular Perfusion Augmentation for Critical Care, EPACC, is a small aortic balloon catheter that is placed retrograde from the femoral artery into the proximal descending aorta. Using only partial inflation of the balloon, the device acts like a ""resistor"" in the aorta to control blood pressure above the balloon while continuing to permit flow past the balloon. Balloon inflation and deflation is automated through a series of algorithms that allow the balloon to rapidly tailor balloon volume movements to the patient's physiology. A recent small pilot study in a pig model of cardiac arrest demonstrated that EVAC can decrease the rate of rearrest from 60% to 0% in the early period after the heart has restarted. This study will model the first 24 hours of post-arrest resuscitation and critical care in a pig model of cardiac arrest with and without EPACC. Specifically, Aim 1 of this proposed research will study the effects of EPACC on the heart and the rate of rearrest, Aim 2 will study the effects of EPACC on the brain and on cerebral perfusion, and Aim 3 will study the effects of EPACC on organs distal to the balloon. This proposed work will identify the potential benefits of EPACC during post-cardiac arrest care and provide the foundation for future clinical trials if found to be effective.",5,5R01HL163145-03,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",14,3,6,2

The role of 53BP1 in double-strand break repair has been well described with a large body of literature. However, there is very limited understanding of how 53BP1 impacts p53 with contrasting reports on mechanism and function. Perturbing 'normal' mitosis caused a p53dependent cell cycle arrest which was dependent on 53BP1 and its known interactor USP28. The suggested mechanism was that 53BP1/USP28 played a role in the stability and nuclear localization of p53. Another study reported that 53BP1/USP28 accentuated the transactivation function of p53 in response to DNA damage/stress. Loss of 53BP1/USP28 impaired the chromatin recruitment of p53 but did not impact p53 protein levels. We recently identified Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator (Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator), as a direct interactor and regulator of 53BP1 function in double-strand break repair. 53BP1 recruitment to double-strand breaks by recognition of histone H4 dimethylated at lysine K20 is inhibited by Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator binding to the Tudor domain of 53BP1. Like p53, Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator also binds 53BP1 independent of chromatin and double-strand breaks. We speculated that Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator may regulate the interaction of p53 with 53BP1, and influence 53BP1-mediated activation of p53. Loss of Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator indeed enhanced the interaction of 53BP1 and p53 resulting in an aberrant increase in p53's gene-transactivation function. Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator specifically inhibited the complex formation between the Tudor domain of 53BP1 and a dimethylated form of p53 that is poised for transcriptional activation of its target genes. The impact of Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator loss on p53 gene expression was partially rescued by depletion of 53BP1 or USP28. Therefore in Aim 1 we propose to investigate the interplay of Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator with 53BP1/USP28 in regulating p53 transactivation function. Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator is a RNA binding protein and our prior structural studies revealed two noncanonical RNA binding motifs in Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator. We systematically identified Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator bound transcripts and discovered that Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator directly binds transcripts of several p53-regulated genes. The binding occurs near the transcription start sites (transcription start sites) and the 3'UTR of these transcripts. Based on this data we hypothesize that Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator may influence transcriptional elongation and mRNA stability, providing a 53BP1-independent mechanism by which Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator regulates the p53 signaling axis. This hypothesis will be tested in Aim 2. Exploring the clinical relevance of Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator mediated inhibition of p53, we observed that amplification of the Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator genomic locus in human carcinomas is mutually exclusive from TP53 mutation/deletions and amplifications of the MDM2/4 loci suggesting that these are distinct mechanisms of suppressing p53 function. We generated a Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator-deficient mouse model to investigate the idea that loss of Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator will prevent the formation of p53-proficient tumors. Our preliminary results support this idea as these animals in the context of p53 heterozygosity, resembling Li Fraumeni syndrome (Li Fraumeni syndrome) patients, have dramatically reduced tumorigenesis. In Aim 3 we will define the relevance of Tudor Interacting Repair Regulator in cancer biology at the organismal level.",5,5R01CA264900-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,10,10,2,4

Alzheimer's disease development is likely driven by inflammation in the central nervous system (central nervous system), yet there remain no broadly effective therapies. We propose that Alzheimer's disease pathology may be, in part, caused by circadian dysregulation of peripheral immune cell migration through the central nervous system. The circadian clock is a critical regulator of biological processes, generating ~24 h rhythms in gene expression, hormone release, and behavior, but its efficacy in various cells and tissues deteriorates with age. Up to 70% of individuals with Alzheimer's disease experience circadian disruption and sleep-wake disturbances, which often present years before clinical diagnosis. Circadian dysregulation is therefore a potential biomarker and signal for early intervention in ageand Alzheimer's disease-related pathology. The immune system is tightly regulated by the circadian clock, generating daily cycles of immune cell migration throughout the body which leads to temporal windows of high and low immune reactivity. The immune system also critically regulates central nervous system function; peripheral inflammation disrupts behavior and impairs cognition. During aging, the central nervous system immune system gradually shifts from a balance between proand antiinflammatory function towards a more reactive inflammatory state. Importantly, trafficking of adaptive immune cells to immune-brain interfaces regulates neuroinflammation and cognition. Thus, we hypothesize that circadian rhythms in immune cell trafficking to the central nervous system are disrupted with age and Alzheimer's disease-like pathology, leading to cognitive and behavioral changes. This proposal addresses the following specific aims: First, establish the role of circadian dysregulation of immune cell trafficking in central nervous system inflammation and cognitive decline during aging and Alzheimer's disease-like pathology; second, determine if disruption of molecular clocks in key brain-immune interface cells expedites cognitive decline during aging and Alzheimer's disease-like pathology; and third, reveal whether reinstating daily trafficking rhythms via time-restricted feeding ameliorates ageand Alzheimer's disease-induced pathology. This proposal is innovative in combining expertise in circadian biology, immunology, and behavioral neuroscience to understand how circadian regulation of brain barriers and immune cell trafficking through the central nervous system regulates aging and Alzheimer's disease-like pathology. This contribution will be significant because our results will identify how circadian regulation of adaptive immune cell migration through the central nervous system affects local neuroimmune function. We expect that our results will identify a novel role for biological rhythms in regulating neuroinflammatory pathology and cognition via immune cell migration, highlighting novel therapeutic avenues to target cognitive decline and behavioral changes in aging, Alzheimer's disease, and Alzheimer's disease-related dementia.",5,5R01AG078758-03,RFA-AG-22-017,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,2,6,5,1

However, the signal-to-noise and resolution advantage of 7T MRI is counterbalanced by increased heterogeneity of the static B0 and transmit B1+ fields that degrade image quality, which in turn slows clinical translation for example for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy or multiple sclerosis lesions in the lower part of the brain/cerebellum. Parallel transmission (pTx) is a popular solution to the problem of inhomogeneous B1+ but is costly (~$100k per transmit channel x 8 or 16 channels) and leads to complex specific absorption rate (specific absorption rate) management requiring lengthy electromagnetic simulations that need to be validated. B0 field inhomogeneities close to the sinuses and ear canals can be greatly reduced using multi-channel (multi-channel) shim arrays that place dozens of small loops close to the head and can be rapidly be switched on/off, thus allowing dynamic (slice-byslice) shimming which outperforms global brain shimming with conventional spherical harmonics shim coils. Despite the potential of pTx and multi-channel shim arrays, those state-of-the-art technologies are not being quickly translated to the clinics because of the cost and complexity of combining and operating them. In fact, most 7T systems currently operate in single channel mode with conventional spherical harmonics shim coils, and therefore do not address head-on the dual problems of B0 and B1+ field inhomogeneities, thus likely yielding sub-optimal image quality that may affect the perceived clinical value of 7T MRI. We propose a bioengineering research program leveraging the field control capability of multi-channel shim arrays to homogenize the flip-angle at 7T, thus yielding an integrated solution for B0 and flip-angle shimming that bypasses the need for pTx. We develop pulse design strategies that use the degrees-of-freedom of multi-channel shim arrays for flip-angle control while minimizing power requirements and specific absorption rate. This includes general spokes and kT-point pulses where the gradient blips are replaced by multi-channel shim array blips with more general spatial distributions, as well as optimal control of RF, gradient and multi-channel shim current waveforms based on a direct optimization of Bloch dynamics. We use those approaches to design ""universal"" pulses that can be played quickly without preparation. We simulate and build an multi-channel shim array integrated with the RF coil (""AC/DC"" design) that is optimized for simultaneous B0 and flip-angle shimming performance, which we evaluate in healthy subjects and multiple sclerosis patients.",1,1R01EB034274-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING,14,8,7,1

Outside of the plant, ∆8-THC can be easily synthesized from CBD. As a result of federal and state policy changes, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, and the absence of clear guidance on the control status of ∆8-THC, manufacturers have produced large supplies of this cannabinoid, which is now available to the public everywhere unregulated, in spite of clear warning from the CDC and FDA to the possible risks of consuming ∆8-THC containing products. The synthetic process of converting hemp-derived CBD to ∆8-THC results in several impurities in the marketed products. Our group has identified 15 impurities, eight of them with no known pharmacological properties. The goal of this proposal is directed toward the isolation and characterization of these impurities in sufficient supply to study their pharmacology and their interaction with ∆8-THC. This will be achieved through the following set of specific aims: Aim 1: To scale up the isolation process for ∆8-THC products' impurities to prepare enough supply for both in vitro and in vivo evaluation. Aim 2: To assess the affinity, potency, and behavioral effects of ∆8-THC products' impurities. This will be carried out using in vitro assays to study the binding affinity of each impurity to human CB1, CB2, and GPR55 receptors. Efficacy and potency will be evaluated using functional GTPγS and/or cAMP assays as well as calcium mobilization assays in cultured neurons. Further, in vivo testing of impurities' effects on body temperature, locomotion, catalepsy and nociception will be evaluated in cohorts of male and female mice (tetrad assay). Aim 3: To determine whether ∆8-THC impurities can potentiate, antagonize, or be additive to the psychoactive effects of ∆8-THC through both in vitro and in vivo studies. Our team has the necessary expertise to achieve these goals. At the conclusion of this work, we will have a good understanding of the pharmacology of these impurities and how they influence the effects of ∆8-THC.",1,1R21DA060394-01,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,0,1,8,2

The SEL1L-HRD1 protein complex represents the most conserved branch of endoplasmic reticulumAD from yeast to humans. We recently showed that SEL1L-HRD1 endoplasmic reticulumAD protein complex coordinates with autophagy, or specifically endoplasmic reticulum-phagy, in adipocytes to ensure the maturation of lipoprotein lipases (lipoprotein lipases), a key enzyme involved in lipoprotein hydrolysis and systemic lipid partitioning, in the endoplasmic reticulum. endoplasmic reticulumAD degrades misfolded nascent lipoprotein lipases in the endoplasmic reticulum and, when endoplasmic reticulumAD is impaired, lipoprotein lipases forms aggregates and sequestered in endoplasmic reticulum fragments which are subsequently cleared by endoplasmic reticulum-phagy. When endoplasmic reticulumAD and autophagy are both compromised, endoplasmic reticulum fragments containing lipoprotein lipases aggregates spatially coalesce into a distinct cellular architecture termed Coalescence of endoplasmic reticulum Fragments (Cendoplasmic reticulumFs). Proteomics screens identify lipoprotein lipase (lipoprotein lipases) and endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP as principal components of Cendoplasmic reticulumFs. Hence, our data point to a synergism between endoplasmic reticulumAD and autophagy in adipocytes; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains vague. Our proteomics screens for SEL1L and lipoprotein lipases interactors both identified CCPG1, an endoplasmic reticulum-resident endoplasmic reticulum-phagy receptor, as a top hit. Strikingly, our preliminary data showed that CCPG1 interacts with lipoprotein lipases and is an endoplasmic reticulumAD substrate, i.e. degraded by SEL1L-HRD1 endoplasmic reticulumAD, suggesting that CCPG1 may link endoplasmic reticulumAD to endoplasmic reticulum-phagy of lipoprotein lipases aggregates. Demonstrating the clinical relevance, we further showed that disease-causing lipoprotein lipases variants in patients with familial hypertriglyceridemia are retained intracellularly as large aggregates in the absence of endoplasmic reticulumAD. We will test the hypothesis that SEL1L-HRD1 endoplasmic reticulumAD regulates endoplasmic reticulum-phagy activity via endoplasmic reticulum-phagy receptor CCPG1 to maintain endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and ensure the maturation of secreted proteins such as lipoprotein lipases in adipocytes. This model expands the current paradigm in endoplasmic reticulum biology by placing SEL1L-HRD1 endoplasmic reticulumAD at the center of cellular quality-control function and identifying new lipoprotein lipases regulators. Using various mouse models, we will  determine whether SEL1L-HRD1 endoplasmic reticulumAD regulates endoplasmic reticulum-phagy of lipoprotein lipases aggregates via CCPG1 in adipocytes; and  delineate the pathological importance of SEL1L-HRD1 endoplasmic reticulumAD and CCPG1-mediated endoplasmic reticulum-phagy in the pathogenicity of lipoprotein lipases disease mutants and its underlying mechanism. This study will provide unprecedented insights into the role of various key endoplasmic reticulum quality control machineries in regulating lipoprotein lipases biology in adipocytes. RELEVANCE TO HUMAN HEALTH: lipoprotein lipases deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that can lead to abnormal accumulation of triglycerides in the blood and an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This study will establish a key mechanism underlying the regulation of lipoprotein lipases maturation in adipocytes and shed light on the crosstalk between endoplasmic reticulumAD and endoplasmic reticulum-phagy in adipocytes in health and diseases.",1,1R01DK137794-01,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,5,7,2,0

Wnt signaling is essential for intestinal stem cell maintenance and aberrant activation of this pathway drives the initiation and progression of nearly all colorectal cancers. To date, no drugs that inhibit the Wnt pathway have been FDAapproved, partly due to the lack of druggable targets that can bypass common Wnt pathway mutations in CRC. In a conceptual breakthrough, our recently published findings reveal that Cereblon (Cereblon), the substrate receptor of the CRL4Cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase that is a drug target in hematological malignancies, plays a critical role in Wnt signal transduction. We found that Cereblon promotes the degradation of a subset of substrates, including Casein kinase 1α (Casein kinase 1α), a negative regulator of Wnt signaling and a key component of the β-Catenin destruction complex. Moreover, Wnt stimulation induces the interaction of Cereblon with Casein kinase 1α to promote its ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, we showed that the role of Cereblon in Wnt signaling is conserved in human cells, mouse intestinal organoids, zebrafish, and Drosophila. These studies demonstrate the first endogenous mechanism of Cereblon regulation and provide a novel means of controlling Wnt pathway activity, with relevance for animal development and disease. The goal of this project is to use in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo approaches to gain a better understanding of how the clinically relevant anti-cancer target, Cereblon, promotes Wnt signal transduction. The three specific aims are to: 1) Identify the mechanisms by which Wnt stimulation activates Cereblon; 2) Identify Wnt-stimulated Cereblon interactors that regulate tumorigenesis; and 3) elucidate the role of Cereblon in Wnt-dependent cancer progression. Because Cereblon is a well-studied target for the development of drugs to treat hematological malignancies, the knowledge gained from this study will aid in the development of more selective small molecules as well as suggest innovative treatment strategies for CRC and other Wnt-driven cancers.",5,5R01CA281002-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,5,7,2,0

The platform will allow the loading of drugs into exosomes with high efficiency, biomanufacturing of exosomes in high throughput, and further engineering exosome-based drug delivery systems for various diseases with desired functions including targeted delivery, tracking, and combinational therapies. Exosomes are a subset of extracellular vesicles, with diameters between 50 nm and 150 nm, secreted by most eukaryotic cells. They are very promising drug delivery vehicles due to their small size, biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and reduced toxicity in comparison with synthetic nanoscale formulations such as liposomes, dendrimers, and polymers. Delivery of anticancer drugs contained in exosomes demonstrated improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and enhanced anticancer activity in vivo compared to free drug molecules. Loading of therapeutic nucleic acids into exosomes protects the nucleic acids from nucleases and increases cellular uptake and the therapeutic effect due to specific molecular mechanisms of exosome internalization. Exosomes can cross the blood brain barrier and penetrate deep tissues with improved efficacy compared to that of synthetic nanocarriers. Moreover, they play a key role in cancer metastasis and regeneration by inducing transcriptomic and phenotypic changes with their RNA and protein cargoes. Therefore, they can potentially be reengineered for delivery of gene and protein therapeutics. However, there remain fundamental challenges to the utilization of exosomes in the clinic: i) drug loading efficiency into exosomes is very limited; ii) the production of exosomes has yet to reach sufficiently high throughput for clinical tests or even further development; and iii) endowing exosomes with multiple abilities for satisfactory disease targeting, tracking and combinational therapies is highly demanding. To address these challenges, the PI proposes the following three projects: 1) Developing a high-efficiency exosome drug loading technology with chiral graphene nanoparticles; 2) Developing an exosome production bioreactor with stimulating piezoelectric nanofibrous scaffolds; and 3) Engineering hybrid exosomes as a multifunctional targeted delivery system with targeting ligands and functional chiral graphene quantum dots for near-infrared imaging-guided photothermal cancer therapies. The proposed research contains several innovative approaches of exosome production, loading and engineering that, if successful and integrated, will provide a high-throughput and high-efficiency exosome manufacturing platform for drug delivery, and expand exosome-based drug delivery to diverse biomedical and clinic applications by combining the merits of both the native exosomes and synthetic nanoparticles.",5,5R35GM150608-02,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,17,8,2,4

Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease) poses a growing burden on our society, with cases expected to reach 12.7 million by 2050. While research supports biomarkers for early detection, most Alzheimer's patients are diagnosed after exhibiting clinical symptoms. At this stage, the advanced progression of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles pose significant challenges to effective interventions. Moreover, established biomarkers, such as amyloid beta-42/amyloid beta-40 and phosphorylated tau, are currently limited to analysis in cerebrospinal fluid, making their potential for routine screening nearly impossible. Thus, there is a critical need for novel, non-invasive approaches to rapidly screen for preclinical Alzheimer's to facilitate the application of early interventions, such as physical, pharmaceutical, and cognitive therapies. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of circulating extracellular vesicles as a promising source of biomarkers to monitor and diagnose various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. However, accessible technologies to accurately detect Alzheimer's disease-associated extracellular vesicles and their constituents are not currently in clinical practice. Moreover, concentrations in blood are present in the low picoto femtomolar range, limiting conventional detection by ELISA and Western blot. This proposal aims to address these critical needs and focuses on developing a new platform to detect tau in neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (neuron-derived extracellular vesicles). We hypothesize that ultrasensitive detection (< 5 pg/mL) of NDEV-tau can be achieved by optimizing our surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (spectroscopy) nanotag technology using a rational design-of-experiment approach. If our hypothesis is correct, we expect this work to serve as the foundation for developing a point-of-care device that can be used for routine screening of pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. With this goal in mind, we will focus on the following specific aims:  Synthesize 'spectroscopy nanotags' with a high affinity for NDEV-tau and identify the characteristics for effective binding;  Assess NDEV-tau sensitivity and specificity using the spectroscopy platform in spiked human serum. Ultimately, we expect to establish the limit of detection and sample volumes needed for accurate tau detection. By engineering spectroscopy-active substrates for ultrasensitive detection of NDEV-tau, we can then build upon this platform to enhance the multiplexing of several Alzheimer's disease-associated biomarkers in complex biological samples. Our long-term goal is to develop spectroscopy-based bioanalysis to drastically improve current standards in molecular detection for Alzheimer's disease in both clinical and research settings.",5,5R16GM149496-02,PAR-21-169,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,2,6,6,1

Regional patterning of the human neural tube is a tightly regulated process, deviation from which can result in neurodevelopmental disorders and may lead to distinct neurological and psychiatric diseases later in life. Regional patterning of the human neural tube remains incompletely understood due to limited access to human embryonic tissues. Animal models have been instrumental in understanding the development of human central nervous system and associated disorders. However, they are limited in revealing some fundamental aspects of development, genetics, pathology, and disease mechanisms that are unique to humans. Stem cell-based in vitro models of human nervous system development, including neural organoids and bioengineered neural tube development models, are emerging as promising experimental tools. However, none of the current stem cell-based neural development models is capable of recapitulating neural patterning along two orthogonal axes in a 3D tubular geometry, the hallmark of neural tube patterning in vivo. Furthermore, the existing neural development models only recapitulate certain aspects of the development of either human brain or spinal cord regions but not both. In our preliminary study, we have successfully leveraged the developmental potential and selforganizing property of human pluripotent stem cells (human pluripotent stem cells) in conjunction with microfluidics to develop the first of its kind, synthetic, fully patterned human neural tube model. Using this microfluidic platform, exogenous morphogen gradients along two orthogonal axes can be established to achieve regional patterning of the microfluidic human neural tube-like structure along both the R-C and D-V axes, in both brain-like and spinal cord-like regions. This microfluidic patterned human neural tube-like structure exhibits many hallmarks of neural tube development, including a tubular geometry, a single continuous central lumen enclosing by neuronal progenitor cells, patterned expression of canonical R-C and D-V regional markers including HOX genes, and the emergence of neural mesodermal progenitors and the isthmic organizer. Thus, the development of the microfluidic human neural tube-like structure closely mimics neural tube development, offering for the first time an in vivo-like tissue architecture with consistent spatiotemporal cell differentiation and organization. The goal of this R01 research is to develop this exciting microfluidic human neural tube-like model (Aim 1) and leverage its technical advantages to study the roles of different exogenous morphogen signals in neural patterning (Aim 2 & 3). Genetic perturbations and lineage tracing assays will be conducted to study human neural mesodermal progenitor development (Aim 2). In Aim 3 we further aim to achieve D-V patterned human neural tube-like structures with either forebrain or spinal cord identities and use these structures to recapitulate interregional cellular interactions and excitation-to-inhibition interplays during cortical development.",5,5R01NS129850-02,PAR-20-055,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,15,7,2,0

Recent findings from the EMBARC study have shown that small lipid molecules called eicosanoids, which act as both activators and suppressors of inflammatory activity as well as modulators of innate and adaptive immunity, are known to have a significant impact on the subacute and chronic sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, in addition to risk for unresolved immune-mediated inflammatory conditions such as CVD. Eicosanoids have also been found to be a contributor of chronic neuroinflammatory conditions such as depression in other studies. Advanced mass spectrometry methods now allow for the rapid and accurate quantification of hundreds of upstream eicosanoid mediators representing multiple enzymatic origins. Hence, this proposal aims to provide a more detailed understanding of how upstream eicosanoid pathways can be variably active, imbalanced, and perturbed in relation to an individual's propensity for developing depression. We will leverage the expertise of an interprofessional team, including current members of the EMBARC research study team, to test the hypothesis that: 1) SARS-CoV-2 infection and reinfections moderate development of chronic immune-mediated neuroinflammatory condition such as depression as evidenced by changes in eicosanoid profiles; and 2) health impacts of social determinants of health compounds depression risk following SARS-CoV-2 infection and reinfection by moderating the neuroimmune-inflammatory response. We propose a systematic approach to comprehensively investigating the components of upstream inflammatory activity in relation to outcomes across the spectrum of depression risk through the collection of longitudinal (survey, clinical, biomarker) data from a large and diverse population of people already enrolled in the EMBARC research study and will use a variety of methods (e.g., eicosanoid profiling, use of public available health equity data set) to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection and the social determinants of health impact on neuroinflammation that is associated with depression. This work will pave the way for follow-up studies investigating the efficacy of antiinflammatory therapies, including both existing and novel agents, for modulating variation in distinct eicosanoids and, in turn, mental health outcomes such as depression.",1,1R01MH136492-01,PAR-21-038,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,8,1

The central hypothesis is that the principal targets for a syphilis vaccine reside within Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum's repertoire of rare outer membranePs. The current application builds upon the work of the current CRC U19 grant awarded to the two mPIs of this proposal (Moody and Radolf).

The Global Burden of Disease Study has found that, among the top 17 risk factors, poor diet is overwhelmingly the No. 1 risk factor for human diseases. Despite the strong connection between diet and health, unhealthy foods with large portion sizes are widely consumed. Currently, 68.5% of U.S. adults are overweight, among the highest in developed countries. The recent decline in U.S. life expectancy sent another alarming signal about the general health of the American people. Understanding how the diet-related risk factors affect people's health and finding effective ways to empower them in improving lifestyle habits are among the most important tasks in public health. Unfortunately, dietary assessment in real-world settings has been exceedingly complex and inaccurate to implement. Technology is needed that allows researchers to assess dietary intake easily and accurately in real world settings so that effective intervention to manage obesity and related chronic diseases can be developed. We propose a biomedical engineering project to address the dietary assessment problem, taking advantage of advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial intelligence. Our research team has been improving the ability to assess diet for over a decade. We have designed the eButton, a small wearable device pinned on clothes in front of the chest, capable of collecting image-based dietary data objectively and passively (i.e., without depending on subject's self-report or volitional operation of the device). We have also developed algorithms to compute food volumes and nutrients from images. Since the eButton was developed, it has been used by many researchers in the U.S. and other countries for objective and passive diet-intake studies in both adults and children. Despite the past successes, there have been two lingering critical problems associated with the objective and passive dietary assessment using wearable devices: 1) substantial manual efforts are required for researchers to visually examine image data to identify foods and estimate their volumes (portion sizes), and 2) there are privacy concerns about researchers' viewing of participants' real-life images. Although solving these problems could enable the eButton and other wearable devices for large-scale diet-intake studies, we were not able to find effective solutions until recently when Artificial intelligence (Artificial intelligence) emerged. Advanced Artificial intelligence systems, especially those based on deep learning, can be trained by large amounts of labeled data to produce results comparable or even superior to those produced by human in numerous fields of applications. Artificial intelligence technology is also a powerful tool for dietary assessment, potentially providing an ideal solution to the two previously mentioned problems. We thus propose to develop a human-mimetic Artificial intelligence system to recognize foods from images, estimate portion sizes, and find energy and nutrient values from a database in a fully automatic process. Using the Artificial intelligence approach, there will be no need for researchers to view participants' real-life images, and the Artificial intelligence system well-respects individuals' privacy because it is trained to recognizes human foods only, nothing else. Currently, the performances of existing Artificial intelligence systems are limited by the extensive variety and high variability of human foods, insufficient training data, and difficulty in finding appropriate nutritional information from food databases. In this application, we propose a new strategy to personalize the Artificial intelligence system for each research participant using an advanced mathematical model of personal food choices. With this personalization step, the dimensionality of our envisioned Artificial intelligence system can be reduced drastically, and our goal of automatic, objective and passive dietary assessment can be reached realistically. We also propose to improve the electronic hardware and develop a biomimetic camera to enlarge the field of view for the eButton. Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation of the personalized Artificial intelligence system in real-world settings using human subjects.",5,5R01DK127310-04,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,1,3,3,2

Spatially separated junctions line individual epithelial membranes and are tasked with linking cells to one another and to the underlying extracellular matrix. These junctions are composed of well-characterized membrane proteins, each with unique functions: claudins create paracellular barriers; cadherins bind cells together; and integrins attach cells to matrix. Despite unique classes of membrane proteins, different junctions all possess a common element, the cytoskeleton, which resides on the cytosolic side of the contact. One cytoskeletal polymer in particular - actin - appears indispensable for junction activity. While decades of elegant work have transformed our understanding of the structure and binding characteristics of junctional membrane proteins, the question of how actin is involved in cell junction formation, junction maintenance and repair, and junctional signaling remains unresolved. Actin filaments are ubiquitous throughout the cell as they contribute to cell shape, endocytosis, mitosis, motility, and other critical phenomena. However, this wide distribution presents a fundamental problem when studying actin - namely how to pinpoint the exact role actin filaments play in the process-of-interest. While actintargeted natural products and small molecules are widely used to disrupt filaments globally, they lack the specificity needed to uncover the role of actin filaments locally at cell junctions. My research group is developing a suite of molecular tools to both control and dissect actin interactions at cell junctions. In this way, we provide researchers with new methods to turn-on and -off actin association and to probe actin's role in adhesion and cell-cell mechanics. These tools come in various molecular forms: i) protein-based switches, ii) small-molecule molecular glues and inhibitors, and iii) synthetic cells, which can be applied to wide-ranging systems, such as reconstituted membranes, cells, monolayers, tissues, and organisms, to illuminate and manipulate actindependent processes. In my lab, we will harness these molecular tools to focus on three specific research directions in epithelial biology, although we anticipate that the toolkit will benefit the greater biological community, including biochemists, cell biologists and developmental biologists. First, we will focus on applying our tools to dissect actin's role during tight junction maturation and, ultimately, to modulate barrier function. Second, we will investigate, in mechanistic detail, how actin potentiates integrin activation during focal adhesion formation. Finally, we will assemble cells using actin switches to generate ""synthetic tissues"" with programmable and toggleable properties, such as dynamic tissue permeability and adhesion.

These disease sites now employ involved nodal radiotherapy (INradiation therapy), focusing on involved lymphadenopathy. However, in head and neck cancer (head and neck cancer), we still target the same lymph node regions as conventional 2D radiotherapy, despite our ability to tailor the radiotherapy volume (CTV and dose to specific areas using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMradiation therapy). This approach leads to excessive acute and long-term toxicities for head and neck cancer patients after radiation therapy. Therefore, INradiation therapy is highly desirable for head and neck cancer. In INradiation therapy, one particular challenge during gross tumor volume (CTV (gross tumor volume (CTV) and clinical target volume (CTV (clinical target volume (CTV) delineation is the identification of malignant lymphadenopathy. While some lymph nodes (lymph nodes) are obviously malignant based on standard imaging modalities, there is often uncertainty about whether a LN is malignant and requires targeting. Treating benign nodes as malignant may cause a significantly higher risk of late complications, such as xerostomia and dysphagia. On the other hand, missing occult lymphadenopathy will lead to regional recurrence. The goal of this project is to develop, optimize, and test a multifaceted predictive model with both high sensitivity and specificity for LN metastasis classification to maximize the efficacy and minimize the toxicity of INradiation therapy for head and neck cancer. The proposed multifaced model presents a flexible framework and considers multiple aspects of a predictive model, including: 1) Evaluation criteria used in model training (multiobjective); 2) Different sources of information (multi-modality); and 3) Classifiers used for model construction (multi-classifier). By designing a multi-objective function, we will consider sensitivity and specificity simultaneously during model training and optimization. Instead of blindly combining features extracted from different modalities and empirically choosing one preferred classifier, the information extracted by modalityspecific classifiers will be combined optimally through a reliable classifier fusion (reliable classifier fusion) strategy. We will develop a prospective registry database to train the multi-classifier, multi-objective and multi-modality (multi-classifier, multi-objective and multi-modality) model through prospectively collecting clinical characteristics and images of head and neck cancer patients who will undergo surgery at UTSW with pathology-confirmed LN metastasis status. The model will be validated on an independent UTSW patient cohort and patients who underwent outside imaging but operated at UTSW. The specific aims of the project are: 1) Develop and validate a multi-classifier, multi-objective and multi-modality (multi-classifier, multi-objective and multi-modality) LN metastasis prediction model for head and neck cancer patients. 2) Conduct a randomized phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and utility of INradiation therapy versus conventional radiotherapy for head and neck cancer using the multi-classifier, multi-objective and multi-modality model. Successful completion of this project will result in the development and validation of a strategy that can identify malignant lymph nodes in head and neck cancer with high sensitivity and specificity, which will lead to improved outcomes for head and neck cancer patients who receive INradiation therapy.",5,5R01CA251792-03,PAR-21-033,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,17,0,4,4

The highestincome American men live nearly 15 years longer on average than the lowest-income American men; the corresponding gap for women is 10 years. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified these disparities by income, race, and other dimensions. Unfortunately, we currently lack information on how mortality rates due to COVID19 vary with individual income, because available U.S. population mortality data lacks information on income. The absence of this information has hindered our ability to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and develop policies to mitigate its impacts, particularly on disadvantaged and underserved populations, going forward. This project will resolve these challenges by constructing a new public database of mortality rates incorporating socioeconomic and demographic variables and covering the entire U.S. population. Using these data, researchers will be able to analyze the sources of disparate impacts of COVID-19 on mortality across subgroups, with the aim of understanding how to reduce health inequality in the pandemic and beyond. The project has three specific aims. Aim 1 of this project is to release a new public database of mortality rates by age, income, race/ethnicity, gender and county, and provide recurring annual updates to this database.

However, larval source management has so far not been widely used for malaria vector control in Africa, partly due to the inability to predict habitat locations and stability in many eco-epidemiological settings. larval source management would be greatly facilitated if larval habitat distribution can be predicted a priori so that areas best suitable or unsuitable to larval source management can be identified. Further, if the impact of environmental modifications such as landscape alteration and irrigation on malaria risk can be predicted, optimal larval source management-based vector control program can be developed. Past studies have attempted to use field-based surveys or remotely sensed data for larval habitat identification or correlated environmental factors with malaria risk, but these studies focused on the statistical association between the environmental factors and malaria incidence, and they did not consider the physical processes and environmental regulation on vector larval ecology. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the interactions between the multiple environmental factors that may be highly dynamic and malaria risk was not studied. Recent advancements in parallel computing, hydrological modeling and remote sensing present an excellent opportunity to incorporate hydrologic processes in malaria risk modeling, and subsequently enhance the prediction accuracy. The central objective of this R21 application is to integrate a physically-based hydrologic model with remote sensing and entomological data, to model malaria risk and apply the model to identify optimal larval habitat water management strategies and malaria hotspots. Well-characterized study sites in western Kenya with detailed entomological and epidemiological information will be used to calibrate and validate the model. A unique aspect of this project is the use of multi-layer data such as hydrological, meteorological, topographic, entomological and historical epidemiological parameters to enhance malaria risk prediction. The findings of this project will improve our understanding of the impact of hydrology and other environmental conditions on vector ecology and malaria risk, and enhance malaria control through a priori prediction of transmission hotspots at high spatial resolution and identification of optimal agricultural water management strategies that meet the crop production needs but reduce malaria transmission.",5,5R21AI174183-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

The skin is an ideal accessible target for vaccination. Identifying clinical small molecules with potent adjuvant properties to enable a desirable skin immune microenvironment as a prelude to promote vaccine inducing pathogen and tumor antigen-specific T cell and antibody responses against infectious disease and cancer is an urgent need in clinic. Through screening the NIH Clinical Collection using human skin explant and mouse models, we have identified GR89696, a kappa opioid receptor (KOR)-selective small molecule agonist, triggering gene-expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines with adjuvant effects in skin and increasing skin-infiltration of dendritic cell subsets with specialized capacities for activating CD8 T cells. GR89696 enhances transdermally delivered (via microneedle array) protein vaccine inducing tumor antigen-specific IFNγ+CD8 T cells and antitumor immunity. Clinical KOR-selective small molecule agonist Nalfurafine enhances intradermally delivered protein vaccine inducing antitumor immunity and virus antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies. We hypothesize that KOR-selective small molecule agonist is a novel vaccine adjuvant. We will verify adjuvant effects of KORselective small molecule agonist via KOR activation in skin and assess KOR-selective small molecule agonist adjuvanted vaccine. If successful, we will discover an unexpected adjuvant pathway (targeting KOR) leading to a novel KOR-selective small molecule agonist adjuvanted skin vaccination with the high translational potential.",1,1R21AI176018-01A1,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

BALL relapse is a common problem among infants, adolescents, and adults at all stages. B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias that relapse after cell-based therapies demonstrate antigen remodeling, down-regulation of targeted antigens, and lineage switches to different types of leukemia. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to the emergence of resistant leukemic cells are not well understood. Nearly all B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases share a restricted repertoire of B-cell surface markers. Cell-based therapies targeting these surface receptors unfortunately eliminate all normal B cells, causing pan B-cell ablation and immune dysregulation. This leads to serious complications and the risk of death due to infection in a significant fraction of people who have suffered multiple relapses. To improve patient safety, our project addresses the problems of relapse, opportunistic infections, and organ toxicities in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The pre-B-cell receptor (pre-B-cell receptor) autonomously signals to carry developing B-cells through the proand pre-B stages of differentiation. B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is usually arrested at the proand pre-B stages of differentiation, where these cells are subject to pre-B-cell receptor-mediated autonomous signaling, survival, and clonal expansion. We hypothesize that our novel VpreB1 ADC against the pre-B-cell receptor will de-couple the pathways that allows leukemia cells to survive and become resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Therapies like the one we are developing have lots of toxicities, including side effects that harm liver cells and the cells of the immune system that makes antibodies against infectious diseases. Better immunotherapies can lead to less organ damage, reduce opportunistic infections, and directly target the resistance mechanisms that lead to residual disease in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. No current B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia immunotherapies target autonomous survival signaling. This project is being expressly developed to benefit children, who have unique physiologies and toxicity profiles. By using an AcBut-Calicheamicin linker and payload, we will gain insight into safety data that have been collected by the Children's Oncology Group for children receiving similar linker-toxin payloads. Our approach is responsive to the FDA's Best Pharmaceuticals Act of 2017, which calls for new drugs for children and young adults who face life-threatening diseases, including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in relapse or with highrisk disease at diagnosis. In summary and in response to PAR-20-292, our proposal describes the development of a novel biologic agent, with strategies to mitigate treatment-related toxicities for children and young adults who require treatment for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this proposal, we will:  Continue the developmental trajectory of a novel ADC to address the problems of relapse, opportunistic infections, and other toxicities in the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia;  Evaluate how well our novel ADC targets residual disease in treatment-resistant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia;  Assess the survival and adverse drug effects of our ADC, especially its effect on organ toxicities and infectious complications;  Evaluate how well our novel ADC spares adaptive immunity in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",5,5R21CA280433-02,PAR-20-292,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,16,0,4,4

Research on dNTP metabolism has been traditionally conducted in highly proliferative (e.g. tumor cells), metabolically active (e.g. muscle cells) or virus-infected cells due to the key roles of deoxynucleoside triphosphates in fulfilling demands for cell growth, energy production and viral replication. However, little is known regarding the role of dNTP metabolism in innate immunity, especially in the context of nonpathogen-induced immune activation. A hallmark of innate immune activation is the assembly of the Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome-a dominant innate immune sensor for tissue damage. The Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome is composed of the sensor Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3, the adaptor associated spike-like protein (apoptosis associated spike-like protein) and the effector pro-caspase-1. Assembly of the Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome proceeds with two distinct steps: 'priming' and 'activation'. Priming entails rapid NF-kB activation for initiating de novo synthesis of pro-IL-1β as well as increasing the amount of Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3. In contrast, activation involves the assembly of the Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome machinery, resulting in autocleavage and activation of caspase-1 which then converts immature pro-IL-1β into bioactive IL-1β-a powerful proinflammatory cytokine that ignites inflammation. Although properly controlled Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome activity allows for restoration of homeostasis after traumatic tissue injury by stimulating damage clearance and tissue repair, its aberrant and prolonged activation also promotes the rapid progression of many devastating disorders, including gouty arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, macular degeneration and cancer. It is therefore crucial to understand how Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome activity is regulated in innate immune cells. Recently, we discovered that genetic deletion of CMPK2 or SAMHD1, two key enzymes within the dNTP metabolic pathways responsible for synthesizing or degrading deoxynucleoside triphosphates respectively, orchestrates Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome activation. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this MIRA R35 project is to establish dNTP metabolism as a new layer for innate immune regulation and further delineate its underlying mechanism of action. To achieve this goal, three major scientific questions will be pursued:  how does inflammasome priming regulate the function of dNTP metabolic enzymes?  how does dNTP metabolism control Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome activation? Lastly, since Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome overactivation is a shared pathogenic hallmark of many diseases, we further asked:  do common disease risk factors, such as aging and obesity, dysregulate macrophage dNTP metabolism, thereby permitting Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome overactivation? Completion of this project will not only fill an important knowledge gap in the innate immunity field, but may also guide new therapy development to prevent Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome hyperactivation.",5,5R35GM142654-04,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,3,4,1,3

However, due to a shortfall of human experimental platforms, scientists have investigated neural circuits in model systems that lack the constituent cell types and organizational principles of the human brain. As a result, we are left with a poor understanding of how human neural circuits are configured, impacted by disease processes, and targeted for therapeutic purposes. Here our laboratory will pursue innovative research approaches that specifically advance our knowledge of human neural circuits. Using live brain specimens collected from neurosurgical procedures and CellREADR, a novel genetic tool for cellular access, we will investigate the cellular properties and circuit functional roles of human cortical interneurons. Cortical interneurons are the principal inhibitory cellular elements of neural circuits in the cerebral cortex, and their dysfunction has been implicated in various brain disorders such as epilepsy, autism, and Alzheimer's. While scientists have detailed interneuron form and function in laboratory mice, the cellular diversity, circuit functions, and pathophysiologies of human interneuron populations remain almost entirely unknown. Here, using a range of anatomical, physiological, and transcriptomics methods in ex vivo human brain tissues, we will generate a multimodal phenotypic catalog of human interneurons and characterize their functional organization in neural circuits.

Microglia are a resident immune cell in the cerebral cortex, and one of their main functions under physiological conditions is to modify synaptic connections among neurons. How these activities extend to influence higher-order functional networks in cortical circuits is not clear, particularly in brain regions crucial for cognitive function, such as the prefrontal cortex (prefrontal cortex). A key may lie in how neural circuit synchrony stimulates nearby microglial cell motility - i.e. active extension and retraction of fine cellular processes - and, specifically, in how this relationship changes throughout adolescence, a critical period for the development of prefrontal cortex and higher cognition. Further, sex differences have been established in some aspects of microglial function. Clarifying how sex modulates the role of microglia in prefrontal cortex circuit development is essential, especially given the dramatic sex differences in vulnerability to adolescent onset of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia. The goal of the current project is to obtain a basic understanding of glial-neuronal-circuit interactions in the mammalian prefrontal cortex. The planned approach (Aim 1) employs three-dimensional two-photon microscopy and single neuron optogenetics in awake mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mprefrontal cortex) to elucidate how the structural dynamics of microglial cells are driven by neuronal activity and oscillatory synchrony in local circuits. This will be examined at distinct time windows from pre-adolescence into early adulthood and compared between males and females. (Aim 2,3) To test whether, how, and when microglia activity is necessary for the establishment of adult mprefrontal cortex function, microglia will be selectively eliminated during restricted windows during adolescence and early adulthood using a pharmacological strategy. Then in adulthood, sexand adolescent-period specific effects on the development of i) (Aim 2) spatiotemporal circuit dynamics in mprefrontal cortex (functional network clustering, gamma oscillations, theta-gamma coupling) will be measured using two-photon calcium imaging and dense electrical recordings and ii) (Aim 3) prefrontal cortex-dependent cognition will be assessed with an established odor-based attentional set-shifting task. This project employs state-of-the-art optical techniques to study brain function of behaving animals with celllevel precision. Results will identify when and how microglia interact with developing neuronal circuits to support adult-level cognitive function under physiological conditions. Since microglia may be a key mediator of psychiatric disease-relevant neuroimmune dysfunction, the basic science insights from this project, particularly afforded by a sexand developmental-period stratified approach, could transform the search for core pathophysiological mechanisms and circuit-based treatments.",5,5R01MH128176-03,PAR-21-038,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,5,1

Whereas DNA is embedded in highly-ordered chromatin, DNA damage promptly induces chromatin alterations at sites of damage. One such early change, histone acetylation catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases Tip60 and p300/CBP, not only can promote chromatin access to the DNA-repair machinery, but can regulate DNA-repair pathway choice. As histone acetylation has emerged as a principal mechanism for coordinating DNA damage response, it is of significance to identify genes that can regulate this event upon DNA damage. Activating transcription factor 3 (Activating transcription factor 3) is a stress sensor commonly induced by DNA-damaging agents. We have demonstrated that Activating transcription factor 3 can activate the tumor suppressor p53 while promoting Tip60-mediated activation of the major DNA damage response kinase ATM. We also found that Activating transcription factor 3 is required for genome maintenance and the suppression of spontaneous tumorigenesis in mice. Whereas these results support that Activating transcription factor 3 plays an indispensable role in the DNA damage response, what is currently unknown is whether Activating transcription factor 3 can also actively regulate chromatin dynamics and DNA repair independent of its regulation on p53 and Tip60. The objective of this application is to address this question, and to determine the role of Activating transcription factor 3 in the regulation of DNA repair at the chromatin level. Formulated on the basis of compelling preliminary data, the central hypothesis is that Activating transcription factor 3 recruited to sites of DNA damage promotes p300/CBP to acetylate H3 facilitating the loading of repair proteins for non-homologous end-joining (non-homologous end-joining). To test this hypothesis, we will determine how Activating transcription factor 3 is recruited to DSBs and promotes p300/CBP-catalyzed histone acetylation at DSBs (Aim 1). We will also delineate how histone acetylation regulated by Activating transcription factor 3 alters chromatin structure and facilitates the recruitments of non-homologous end-joining factors (Aim 2). Lastly, we will also use the IR-induced lymphomagenesis mouse model to assess the functional significance of our novel findings (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research is expected to define a novel role that Activating transcription factor 3 plays in genome maintenance, and discover novel mechanisms by which the early chromatin response to DNA damage is regulated.",5,5R01CA240966-04,PA-19-056,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,10,10,2,4

Existing drug therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma such as sorafenib extend patient survival by only three months. We recently developed a massively parallel in vivo screening platform to test the impact of genetic factors such as full-length cDNAs or miRNAs on liver repopulation and tumorigenesis. We have used this screening technology to build a map of all miRNAs active in liver regeneration. Here, we propose to exploit this innovative paradigm to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of the 135 most abundant but evolutionarily conserved hepatic miRNAs on the processes of recovery from toxic liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma tumorigenesis. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the combined benefits of three miRNAs identified in our prior screen on liver repopulation following toxic injuries, as a step toward using miRNA-mimetic drug therapies for liver diseases. This will be accomplished through delivery of miRNA-encoding plasmids or nanoparticles singly and in all combination. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the impact of hepatic miRNAs and miRNA combinations on hepatocellular carcinoma tumor development in vivo. To this end, we have developed two models of rapid hepatocellular carcinoma development in mice, in which we will screen our library of 135 'tough decoys' (""TuD's""), or inhibitors of miRNA action, on tumor formation. We will quantify the abundance of all TuD's using high throughput sequencing in the tumor-loaded liver compared to the input library. TuD's enriched in after tumor formation target miRNAs that normally limit tumor growth, and those found less abundant target miRNAs that promote tumorigenesis. We will then test the combinations of the most potent miRNA effectors on tumor formation following systemic delivery. In Specific Aim 3 we will perform a conditional screen of miRNAs that impact Sorafenib resistance to identify novel combination treatments for the prevention or treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Together, our powerful genetic screens promise to identify miRNA effectors that can be employed for the treatment of acute liver injury and, in combination with Sorafenib, as a more effective treatment to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma initiation and progression.",5,5R01CA249929-10,PA-19-056,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,12,0,4,0

There is growing evidence that in addition to these individual-level stressors, neighborhood-level stressors of the social and built environments also adversely impact cancer survivorship outcomes, including health-related quality of life. Most prior studies of health-related quality of life, however, examined individual-level stressors only and were focused on short-term breast cancer survivors, primarily from nonHispanic White (nonHispanic White) populations. There is a significant gap in knowledge about multi-level stressors that adversely impact health-related quality of life among long-term breast cancer survivors, and it is not known whether key stressors differ among survivors from different racial and ethnic minoritized (racial and ethnic minoritized) and immigrant populations who likely have a greater burden of both individual-level and neighborhood-level stressors.

Two Env Broadly Neutralizing MAb binding sites, the Membrane Proximal External Region (Membrane Proximal External Region) and Fusion Peptide (Fusion Peptide), are attractive targets because they are linear peptides. We developed a new, low cost, globally appropriate vaccine platform: Killed Whole Cell (Killed Whole Cell) Genome-Reduced E. coli (Genome-Reduced E. coli), with vaccine antigens expressed on bacterial surfaces using Gramautotransporters. Using synthetic biology, testable vaccine candidates can be made in ~3 wks for ~$50 each. Vaccines made with the platform will cost ~$1/dose, can be produced in existing factories globally, and have forgiving cold chain requirements. We made coronavirus Fusion Peptide vaccines using the Killed Whole Cell Genome-Reduced E. coli platform and showed clinical efficacy in an animal model. We propose to make Killed Whole Cell Genome-Reduced E. coli HIV vaccines targeting Membrane Proximal External Region and Fusion Peptide. Our preliminary data show that we can express HIV Membrane Proximal External Region and Fusion Peptide Ags with this approach and elicit HIV neutralizing sera in mice immunized with bacteria not expressing viral antigen using an Membrane Proximal External Region-derived Ag. We hypothesize that the Killed Whole Cell Genome-Reduced E. coli platform, targeting Membrane Proximal External Region and Fusion Peptide, will yield safe, effective, low cost, globally appropriate HIV vaccines. In PHASE 1, Aim 1, we will synthesize DNAs encoding Membrane Proximal External Region and Fusion Peptide Ags, employing bioengineering strategies to enhance Ag exposure and antigenicity. We will clone these DNAs into our expression plasmid and transform into Genome-Reduced E. coli to make Killed Whole Cell candidate vaccines.

10756158,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/OEpdru1dvkW_q8PFyG49VQ/project-details/10756158#similar-Projects,Hexosamine biosynthesis pathway metabolism during cardiac hypertrophy,"A broad range of diseases, from hypertension to structural heart diseases like aortic stenosis or coarctation of the aorta, cause pressure overload stress on the heart. In response, the heart undergoes hypertrophy (called pressure overload hypertrophy or POH) which can promote adaptation or cause heart failure. Understanding the mechanism underlying these opposite clinical outcomes would create new therapeutic opportunities. The unstressed heart relies mainly on fatty acids for fuel but alters energy sources depending on availability. POH causes the heart to increase its reliance on glucose for energy, but, unfortunately, this metabolic inflexibility impacts hypertrophic growth and ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, improving the balance of sources used for fuel generation during POH could promote adaptation but therapies targeting this approach have not been realized partially because the mechanisms underlying these metabolic changes are incompletely known. Our preliminary results identified a new mechanism potentially impacting substrate preferences for energy production in the citric acid cycle during POH that we pursue in this proposal. Posttranslational modifications by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) globally increase in hypertrophied hearts in humans and animals. A widely accepted dogma assumes that the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (hexosamine biosynthesis pathway) leading to the O-GlcNAcylation of proteins depends on metabolic changes, especially in glycolytic flux. However, our recent data suggests the reverse; that hexosamine biosynthesis pathway flux and O-GlcNAc levels determine cardiac fuel utilization. We recently performed the most comprehensive evaluation of protein O-GlcNAc changes during POH and preliminarily identified increased O-GlcNAc levels on multiple enzymes for fatty acids and glucose metabolism. Accordingly, we propose a new paradigm that hexosamine biosynthesis pathway flux and O-GlcNAc are key regulators of fuel preferences for the citric acid cycle during POH. Thus, O-GlcNAc could potentially be targeted to treat metabolic inflexibility and prevent cardiac maladaptation during POH. We test our new paradigm with three specific aims: 1) using transgenic mice, we will evaluate the effect of modifying O-GlcNAc levels on left ventricular function and remodeling in POH, 2) we will determine the effect of modifying O-GlcNAc levels on fatty acid oxidation, glucose oxidation and glycolysis during POH, 3) we will determine the regulation of hexosamine biosynthesis pathway flux and O-GlcNAc levels during POH. Our project provides essential insights into the regulation of fuel sources during POH, along with determining the effects of increased O-GlcNAc levels during POH. This knowledge could help develop of new therapeutic approaches to prevent or treat the common clinical problem heart failure from POH. This project addresses key knowledge deficits on the regulation of hexosamine biosynthesis pathway flux and protein O-GlcNAc during hypertrophy, as well as their functional effects during hypertrophy. They will, therefore, provide essential insights on targeting these mechanisms for preventing or treating heart failure.",5,5R01HL163103-02,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,2,0,0

Normal protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in the cytosol and nucleus is maintained by networks of factors that promote protein folding (molecular chaperones) or clearance of terminally misfolded substrates (ubiquitin-proteasome system (ubiquitin-proteasome system), autophagy). Cells grow and proliferate under the constant threat of intrinsic and extrinsic proteotoxic stressors including reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species), exogenous oxidants and reactive electrophiles. However, the interface between proteostasis and cellular reduction-oxidation (reduction-oxidation) buffering pathways, namely the thioreduction-oxidationin and glutathione systems, is not well understood. Our long-term goal is a comprehensive understanding of the biological roles of cytoprotective chaperones, the machinery employed to maintain reduction-oxidation balance and the interplay between them. In this MIRA application we define two independent themes that define our future research program. In the first line of investigation, we will examine reduction-oxidation modulation of cytoplasmic spatial protein quality control and degradation, empowered by our discoveries that the sequestrase Hsp42 accumulates with misfolded proteins and is required for optimal growth in reduction-oxidation-deficient yeast cells that lack a functional thioreduction-oxidationin system. We have also uncovered a new arm of the endoplasmic reticulum-based unfolded protein response (unfolded protein response) pathway that is activated in thioreduction-oxidationin-deficient cells and operates independently of the primary unfolded protein response transcription factor Hac1; we will elucidate the mechanism and biological relevance of this alternate cytoprotective system. The second broad direction will expand our studies of metazoan chaperone mechanisms with both biochemical and animal-based studies using Drosophila based on our discovery of a novel intrinsically disordered region (intrinsically disordered region) in fly and human Hsp110 chaperones with powerful anti-aggregation and anti-amyloid properties. The work outlined in this proposal will expand on our past successful studies of cellular reduction-oxidation and protein quality control networks, exploiting tractable yeast and fly model systems.

These cis-acting elements are found in the 5′-leader regions and regulate expression through their ability to directly bind a specific cellular metabolite with a highly structured receptor called the aptamer domain. Metabolite binding is then communicated to a downstream secondary structural switch in the expression platform that instructs the expression machinery. Genes that are essential for survival or virulence are regulated by riboswitches in numerous medically important pathogens, making riboswitches attractive and novel targets for antimicrobial therapeutics. A long-term goal of my Research Program is to develop a molecular understanding of how mRNA interacts with small molecules and how these interactions drive biological processes. These overarching questions include:  How does RNA create small molecule binding pockets that recognize a spectrum of compounds with high affinity and varying degrees of specificity?  How can structural plasticity be exploited to by RNA-targeting compounds?  What are the mechanisms by which ligand binding drive changes in RNA structure to effect gene regulation? To address these questions, we will use a combination of structural, biophysical, and biochemical approaches as well as in vitro and cell-based functional assays. As our Research Program has developed a detailed understanding of RNA-small molecule interactions, we have begun to leverage this knowledge towards the design of research tools that facilitate basic research and therapeutic application. In this proposal, we are developing novel platforms for tagging RNAs with fluorophores for imaging in live mammalian cells, removing a technical barrier that has limited the study of RNA function. Specifically, we hypothesize that the robust folding and ligand binding properties of riboswitch aptamer domains will provide superior imaging performance over in vitro selected aptamers in cells. Thus, we are developing a set of riboswitch-based tags that bind modular chemical probes and a set of approaches to assess and benchmark their performance in mammalian cells. Recently, we launched a new direction in our Research Program to investigate how classical transcription factors (transcription factors) interact with the transcriptome as part of their regulatory function. We demonstrated that Sox2, a pioneer TF critical for maintenance of pluripotency and neural differentiation, directly interacts with RNA in mouse embryonic stem cells and binds various RNAs in vitro with affinities that rival its consensus DNA promoter site. We observed similar RNA interactions for other Sox and TCF/LEF family proteins, suggesting that RNA binding may be a general property of HMGB proteins that is critically linked to their function. In this proposal, we seek to extend these initial findings to address a set of key questions:  What is the full spectrum of RNAs bound by Sox2?  How does RNA binding impact chromosomal localization?  What is the structural basis for RNA recognition by HMGB proteins?",1,1R35GM152029-01,PAR-22-180,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,10,10,2,0

An estimated 83% of cancer patients report low to very low quality of life. Individuals receiving chemotherapy report experiencing over 13 concurrent symptoms, including fatigue, sleep difficulties, and pain. 30%-40% of people with cancer report significant psychological symptoms, including anxiety and depression. Such disruptions in mental health and quality of life, in turn, exacerbate physical symptoms and can worsen clinical outcomes. Despite growing evidence of the complex, interconnected pathways linking the mind and body, scalable interventions that efficiently target whole-person health upon diagnosis of a life-altering disease such as cancer have not yet been developed. Existing medical treatments, focus on the physiological aspects of the disease. Existing psychological treatments, such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy (Cognitive Behavior Therapy) and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction), apply a broad range of cognitive and behavioral strategies to reduce diffuse symptoms of depression and anxiety. Such ancillary programs for psychological care are routinely proposed as methods to reduce distress and symptoms, restore function, and improve quality of life, but they are frequently inaccessible to patients and notoriously difficult to scale. The MINDSET intervention aims to close this major treatment gap and promote whole patient health by targeting patient mindsets at the point of diagnosis. This proposal builds on our extensive foundational research completed over the past 6 years with support of the NIH New Innovator Award (DP2 AT009511) to test a novel mHealth intervention targeting patient mindsets at the point of diagnosis. In our prior research, we showed that a 2.5-hour digital MINDSET intervention significantly improves whole patient health (physical, social, and emotional functioning as measured by the FACT-G) in patients undergoing systemic treatment for cancer with curative intent compared to a Treatment as Usual (Treatment as Usual) control. Leveraging our interdisciplinary team of experts in oncology, psychology, psychiatry, mHealth, and biostatistics, we aim to expand on this prior research to address this large and costly gap in clinical care. We propose a fully decentralized Phase 3 randomized controlled trial in which 440 cancer patients treated for non-metastatic solid tumors and hematological malignancies will be allocated to either a  MINDSET or  Matched Attention Control (Matched Attention Control) condition. Patient-reported primary outcomes (FACT-G Total Score) and secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, affect, sleep, coping, symptom distress, patient activation/engagement, and inflammatory biology) will be assessed at weeks 0 (baseline), 2, 4, 6, and 10. Durability of the effect of the intervention will be measured at two follow-up timepoints: 3 months, and 6 months after study completion. By promoting health at the psychological, behavioral, and biological levels, MINDSET interventions have the potential to become a highly impactful and complementary tool for promoting whole patient health.",1,1R01AT012618-01,PAR-20-154,NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY & INTEGRATIVE HEALTH,1,3,3,2

We lack a mechanistic understanding of this symptom generally, and specifically require a framework that unites the phenomenon of discomfort with the properties of the visual environment, perception, and neural response. Such a synthesis may be offered by recent work in informationoptimal representation. Computationally ""efficient"" representations represent the statistical structure of the environment and maximize sensory information storage. Recent research in experimental psychology has shown that these ""efficient coding"" models account for aspects of human sensory judgments and the properties of neural activity. Importantly, these models explain how changes in the statistics of the visual environment to lead to changes in perception. Our project is motivated by the idea that photophobia is an experience of ""inefficient"" information processing. Over three Aims we will apply the efficient coding framework to understand the properties of flicker exposure, perception, and neural representation in typical observers and in people with migraine and photophobia. Using personal light-logging devices, we will test the idea that people with migraine and photophobia experience a systematically different visual world.

Pharmacotherapies to treat anxiety disorders overwhelmingly target the diffuse modulatory, serotonergic system, but have limited efficacy. Dopamine is a diffuse, modulatory neurotransmitter known to regulate fear. Yet, dopamine-focused treatments for anxiety disorders are not available. This proposal will test the novel hypothesis that A8 dopamine neurons originating in the retrorubral field normally function to promote fear through projections to the ventral pallidum. We have developed a discrimination procedure in which a minimal threat cue predicts foot shock on 10% of trials, while a neutral cue never predicts shock. Rats show selective, modest fear to the minimal threat cue, allowing us to observe fear exaggeration or fear inhibition via manipulation of A8 dopamine activity. Aim 1 will reveal A8 dopamine bidirectionally controls ventral pallidum firing to a threat cue and cue-elicited fear. Th-cre rats will receive bilateral intra-A8 infusion of a cre-dependent excitatory DREADD (hM4D (hM3D), inhibitory DREADD (hM4D (hM4D), or a control fluorophore. All rats will receive Neuropixels implant along a striatum-pallidum axis. Single units will be recorded from the ventral pallidum and additional striatal regions during minimal threat learning when A8 dopamine activity is intact, chemogenetically excited or chemogenetically inhibited. Results will show that hM3D stimulation of A8 dopamine suppresses ventral pallidum firing and exaggerates fear to minimal threat, while hM4D inhibition of A8 dopamine permits ventral pallidum firing and inhibits fear to minimal threat. Aim 2 will directly tie bidirectional control of fear to activity in the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway. Thcre rats will receive bilateral, intra-A8 infusion of cre-dependent channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin, or a control fluorophore. Optical ferrules will be bilaterally implanted over the ventral pallidum, permitting temporallyspecific manipulations of the A8 to ventral pallidum pathway. Light illumination will occur during cue or control periods during the minimal threat learning procedure. Results will show that channelrhodopsin stimulation of the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway exaggerates fear to minimal threat, while halorhodopsin inhibition of the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway inhibits fear to minimal threat. This proposal will uncover a novel dopaminergic pathway that normally functions to promote fear.

The prevailing view of the neural circuit for fear learning is a division of labor in which the amygdala and associated forebrain regions signal threat probability, and brainstem regions organize fear output. This view is the intellectual foundation for proposals that forebrain threat dysfunction drives exaggerated fear in anxiety disorders. Much more than organizing fear output, my laboratory is showing brainstem networks compute prediction error - a learning signal to drive fear learning. Further, brainstem networks signal threat - a function purported to be specific to the forebrain. This proposal will reveal brainstem networks that signal threat probability, compute prediction error, and organize fear output. Aim 1 will detail the emergence of brainstem threat and behavior signaling dynamics. Female and male rats will receive Neuropixels implant through a complete dorsal-ventral brainstem axis. Thousands of single units will be recorded from 20+ brainstem regions during a fear discrimination procedure that produces selective learning to a threat cue. Firing analyses during the cue period will reveal the emergence of brainstem network threat signaling and tracking of diverse behaviors over fear learning. Aim 2 will establish a framework for brainstem prediction error dynamics. Firing analyses during the outcome period will link brainstem network firing dynamics for prediction error that precede the emergence of fear learning. Aim 3 will reveal forebrain inputs shaping brainstem firing dynamics and fear learning. Rats will receive brainstem Neuropixels implant. AAV2-retro in a brainstem region and cre-casp3 in a forebrain region will be used to delete specific inputs to the brainstem (e.g. prelimibic cortex neurons projecting to the periaqueductal gray). Firing analyses comparing casp3 and control rats will reveal the dependence of brainstem firing dynamics (threat, behavior, and prediction error) on forebrain inputs. Aim 4 will chemogenetically manipulate brainstem firing to diminish prediction error computation and fear learning. Rats will receive brainstem Neuropixels implant. Half will then receive excitatory DREADD infusions in regions flanking the periaqueductal gray - sources of a tonic prediction error organized by firing inhibition. Actuator injections (JH60), but not saline injection, will excite brainstem firing - blocking the tonic prediction error network. Firing analyses will reveal the effects of network interruption on brainstem firing dynamics for threat, behavior, and prediction error. This proposal will extend scientific knowledge by uncovering core threat functions of brainstem networks. The proposal will further reveal how forebrain inputs shape brainstem firing dynamics that signal threat, compute prediction error and organize specific fear behaviors.

Errors in chromosome segregation are the leading cause of miscarriages, and are associated with the vast majority of tumor cells. Despite this, we know very little about why this process is so defective in these circumstances, in large part because the molecules and mechanisms involved are not fully defined. A highly conserved protein complex, the kinetochore, physically attaches chromosomes to the spindle microtubules that are central to pulling chromosomes apart every time a cell divides. Doing this accurately requires kinetochores to remain persistently attached to a constantly changing substrate, the dynamically growing and shrinking tips of the spindle microtubules. They must also sense when they're improperly attached and self-correct these errors. How kinetochores carry out these dynamic functions remains largely mysterious. We propose to investigate two key aspects of the kinetochoremicrotubule interface. First, we know that the ability to sense tension (mechano-sensing) is vital for monitoring erroneous attachments of chromosomes to the spindle. Yet, how mechanical forces are sensed by and transmitted through this megadalton protein assembly is poorly understood. Second, the kinetochore's ability to specifically recognize and bind to various microtubule tip structures is also crucial. How the microtubule side of this interface impacts kinetochore attachment fidelity is unknown, and has remained largely unstudied. Understanding these critical questions has proven challenging because of the lack of ways to measure and manipulate the kinetochore's highly dynamic activities. Prior studies utilized mainly genetic and cell biological approaches, relying on downstream functional readouts that do not directly monitor protein activity. We use an innovative and fundamentally different strategy, combining cutting-edge biochemical and biophysical tools to reconstitute the activities of these protein machines in vitro. The ability to reconstitute these activities allows us to examine both sides of this interface, making our approach uniquely capable of addressing these fundamental questions in innovative ways. Capitalizing on my groundwork in which I identified the first factor, Stu2chTOG, required for a novel mechano-sensing pathway, we have now determined its exact kinetochore binding site via structural analysis and developed genetic tools allowing us to perturb and inducibly re-localize it to kinetochores. We will use these tools to expand insight into the mechanisms of mechano-sensing and extend our knowledge of the factors involved. We will also examine which kinetochore activities are affected by alterations to its microtubule substrate. We have identified numerous tubulin mutations that specifically disrupt chromosome segregation, and our reconstitution-based assays now give us the unique ability to understand this mechanistically. This approach constitutes the first direct examination of the microtubule side of this interface. I anticipate this work will greatly increase our understanding of how kinetochores work to segregate chromosomes and how defects arise in human disease.",5,5R35GM142749-04,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,10,10,2,0

In some cases, humans can host thousands of nematode parasites with little to no pathology, yet our understanding of this incredible evasion or suppression of the immune system remains limited. Modulation of host biology and the pathology they cause is largely effected through the release of proteins and small molecules that interact with host cells and tissues. There are hundreds of proteins released in nematode spit during an infection and only a few have been studied in any detail. My lab is focused on understanding host-parasite interactions, with an emphasis on elucidating the molecules that parasites release into the host, characterizing their interaction with host signaling pathways to modulate host biology, and learning from the evolution of the parasite arsenal how to manipulate the immune system. Over the next five years my lab will identify key genetic pathways in lipid-mediated immune signaling and identify molecular hostparasite interactions. Our specific focus will be to 1) establish experimental pipelines for identifying novel parasite-derived proteins and small molecules that modulate host biology, 2) determine the effects of the molecules we identify, beginning with members of the fatty acidand retinol-binding (fatty acidand retinol-binding) protein family, 3) elucidate molecular interactions between parasite molecules and host pathways, and 4) characterize eicosanoid signaling in Drosophila melanogaster, a genetic model of immunity. A major strategy of my lab's research is to combine in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experimental approaches with an established infection model that leverages our deep understanding of fruit fly biology and its powerful genetics, to reveal not only the binding targets of parasite proteins and molecules in an active infection, but also to define their effect on infection outcomes. Our overall goal is to understand how nematode parasites modify host biology in order to successfully infect them. This includes parasites' ability to evade and/or suppress host immunity, which is important to human health in at least two ways. First, nematode infections continue to be a major source of global morbidity and mortality, affecting more than 25% of the world's population. Increasing drug resistance and recurring infections compound this problem. And second, there is mounting evidence that the immunomodulatory effects of nematode infections can dampen or even eliminate the pathologies that define autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and Celiac disease. Understanding how nematodes suppress the immune system will lead to new treatment and vaccination strategies against nematode infection, and may reveal new avenues for treating autoimmune disorders. We will employ a powerful model system to probe immune modulation by nematodes to identify specific secreted proteins and small molecules as well as the signaling pathways they target to effectively manipulate host immunity.",5,5R35GM137934-05,PAR-17-190,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,7,9,1,3

Previous studies of human samples were limited by low-dimensional single cell methods or high-dimensional bulk methods confounded by cell mixtures. By sequencing RNA of thousands of single cells from lupus nephritis kidneys, we found 21 unique immune cell states, many of which were also found in synovial tissue of RA patients. In Project 2, we will focus on 3 monocyte states that we observe in lupus nephritis kidneys, which likely arise from patrolling blood monocytes that enter the kidney. While these monocytes share expressed genes with the previously described M1/M2 spectrum of monocyte states, they express distinct functional modules and do not map directly to those states. To better understand these disease-associated monocyte states, we will perform experiments to address three hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that monocyte inflammation, phagocytosis, and tissue repair programs in lupus nephritis kidneys are regulated by fibroblasts and tissue-derived factors. With Project 3, we will co-culture primary monocytes with activated/inflammatory fibroblasts together with known local pathogenic factors and determine changes in cellular functions, including phagocytosis, cytokine secretion, endothelial extravasation, T/B cell activation (with Project 1) and other functions. Preliminary data show that fibroblasts and a proposed pathogenic factor, necrotic cells, strongly induce monocyte differentiation. Second, we hypothesize that TFs expressed in lupus monocytes will induce differentiation and expression of disease-associated gene inflammation and tissue repair programs. We will overexpress candidate TFs (based on their expression and genetic association with lupus) in monocytes and assess inflammation, phagocytosis, and differentiation. Preliminary studies show that the TF overexpression is feasible, impacts differentiation, and if successful, would allow reliable in vitro generation of differentiated monocytes for functional studies. Third, to address monocyte roles in lupus nephritis kidneys, we hypothesize that the proximity of monocytes, fibroblasts and tissue lesions, along with expression of fibroblast-induced monocyte gene programs, will reflect cell-cell interactions and functions of monocytes in patient kidneys. Using automated staining, microscopy and image analysis (with the Computational Systems Immunology Core) of kidney sections from up to 205 clinically-annotated lupus nephritis patients, we will visualize and assess colocalization of monocytes, fibroblasts, tissue structures/lesions. Preliminary data shows close contacts between monocytes and fibroblasts and feasibility of scaling our imaging studies to the full cohort. By building on a more accurate definition of monocytes in human lupus nephritis kidneys, developing methods to study them in vitro and in human tissues, we will define the origin, differentiation pathways, functions and spatial locations of monocytes in lupus nephritis, provide a roadmap for mechanistic studies in animal models of disease and identify approaches to manipulate monocytes as potential therapies for lupus nephritis.",5,5P01AI148102-04,PAR-20-072,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,3,4,0,3

Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington's pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor 'switching' during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into subsecond movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements are pieced together into complex motor behaviors . By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people suffering from a variety of neurological disorders.

Here, we examine the circuit mechanisms underlying the neural representation of external space, a representation essential to spatial memory and navigation, and impacted by neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. The neural basis for the representation of space depends, in part, on circuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (medial entorhinal cortex), which contains neurons that encode the spatial position, orientation and running speed of an animal. Between distinct environments, the firing fields of position and orientation cells can change their firing rate and rotate or move to a new spatial location - phenomenon known as 'remapping'. Together with other structures in the parahippocampal region, medial entorhinal cortex neurons can generate unique neural representations for distinct environments, potentially contributing to the encoding of different contexts or episodes. While remapping in medial entorhinal cortex has often been studied between environments that differ in sensory features (i.e. visual or odor cues), we have found in recent and preliminary data that behavioral variables (i.e. running speed, expectation of reward) can evoke internal transitions between neural population states (i.e. remapping) in medial entorhinal cortex. Here, we aim to test the hypotheses that a change in behavioral variables can drive transitions in medial entorhinal cortex neural population states via key nodes in entorhinal circuitry (Aim 1) and that behaviorally driven medial entorhinal cortex spatial maps are optimized to represent features relevant to the navigational behavior executed in the environment (Aim 3). Moreover, we aim to establish causality between changes in behavioral variables and transitions in medial entorhinal cortex neural population states (Aim 2). To address these aims, we propose to combine electrophysiology using silicon probes with spatial and memory tasks in behaving mice. Until now, electrophysiological approaches had to contend with limited recording channel counts, contributing to a lack of studies that considered medial entorhinal cortex neural coding at the population level or as a function of behavioral variables. However, new versions of silicon probes have allowed us to record hundreds of medial entorhinal cortex neurons simultaneously along nearly the entire length of mouse entorhinal cortex. This, combined with virtual reality tasks that can provide dense sampling of sensory and behavioral variables, as well as optogenetic perturbations to establish causality between changes in behavioral variables and transitions in medial entorhinal cortex neural population states, will enable us to achieve significant new insight into the mechanisms underlying transitions in medial entorhinal cortex neural population states and the of such transitions in supporting memory and navigation.",5,5R01MH126904-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,5,1

However, improving care for neuropsychiatric illness will require not only discovering interventions, but also ensuring that research products meet patients' needs and are accessible to underserved groups. While neuroethics to date has largely examined individualistic concerns (such as privacy, consent and identity), this application uses closed-loop neuromodulation as a circuit-based treatment paradigm for examining neuroethical challenges at a societal level such as equity/access and the democratization of research methods. To address challenging topics including socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and geographic disparities will require special expertise in rigorous social science and in community engagement, to include perspectives missing in academic neuroethical discourse. Applying principles of community-engaged research, a Community Advisory Board will be recruited to meet quarterly with project leaders and advise on preliminary findings, research methods and the dissemination of results. Nationwide collaborations have been developed to facilitate research pursuing three specific aims: 1) Compare ethical concerns about novel neurotechnology among diverse groups; 2) Examine practice and patient factors in access to closed-loop neuromodulation in varied clinical settings; and 3) Investigate ethical and practical challenges in reducing barriers to closed-loop neuromodulation research. Aim 1 will address the views of prospective patients/users about neurotechnology in a nationally-representative sample with a focus on underserved groups. Aim 2 will examine the clinic setting via comparative ethnographic research in epilepsy centers using NeuroPace RNS treatment, which is currently the only FDA-approved and commercially available closed-loop brain implant, and therefore can be used to anticipate broader challenges in psychiatry and neurology with future applications of closed-loop approaches. Aim 3 will utilize a novel opportunity for studying ethical concerns in research through a new NIH-funded international collaboration to disseminate expertise and best practices in closed-loop neuromodulation. The approach is innovative, in the applicants' view, addressing societal-level neuroethical concerns with advanced social scientific and community engagement methods not widely applied in neuroethics. The proposed research is significant because it addresses considerations of equity and democratization that are critical to future neurotechnology and neuroscience. Ultimately, this work will broaden the scope of normative issues addressed in neuroethics, such as distributive justice and tensions in broadening research. In neurotechnology, the work will contribute to fuller engagement with ethical challenges in the adoption of new techniques and the early integration of neuroethics in efforts to lower research barriers.",5,5R01MH126997-04,RFA-MH-19-400,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,13,12,7,2

It is widely assumed that understanding the viral and host factors involved in in vivo latency reactivation would lead to new, more rational cure strategies; however, the biology and provenance of the rebounding virus remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to leverage four recent discoveries from our groups to gain insight into the mechanisms of HIV-1 recrudescence. Using ""gold standard"" sampling methods to characterize the latent reservoir before and after treatment interruption (analytical treatment interruption), we discovered that viral isolates derived by quantitative virus outgrowth (QVOA) do not represent or predict the viruses that emerge in the plasma following treatment interruption . We also found that rebound viruses, but not QVOA-derived reservoir viruses, were highly resistant to type 1 interferons (IFN-I), indicating potent host innate responses at the site of viral recrudescence . Surprisingly, some, but not all, rebound suggesting isolates replicated to high titers in macrophages, a greater biological diversity than previously known. Finally, we discovered that IFN-I resistant rebound viruses have the ability to reseed the reservoir, raising the possibility of long-term clinical consequences of analytical treatment interruption . In this application, we will leverage these discoveries to elucidate the viral and host factors that govern HIV-1 rebound. Our hypothesis is that by (i) determining the universality, kinetics and clinical impact of IFN-I resistance during rebound, (ii) defining the viral determinants of IFN-I resistance and the host interferon stimulated genes (interferon stimulated genes) that place pressure on the rebounding virus, and (iii) tracing the provenance of IFN-I resistant rebound viruses, we will uncover key mechanisms that control HIV-1 reactivation from latency. In Aim 1, we will expand our studies to more diverse analytical treatment interruption trial participants, including women, minorities, acute and early ART initiators and individuals receiving IFN-I modulating therapies, to assess the generality of the IFN-I resistant phenotype of rebound viruses. We will also test to what extent IFN-I resistance persists during prolonged analytical treatment interruption and determine how this influences the rates of IFN-I resistant viruses that reseed the reservoir. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the biological properties of rebound HIV-1, map the viral determinants of IFN-I resistance, and identify the host interferon stimulated genes (interferon stimulated genes) that place pressure on the recrudescing virus. In Aim 3, we will trace the provenance of rebound virus by testing blood, thoracic duct lymph and lymphatic tissue using regular and modified QVOAs, examine whether long-lived myeloid cells, including brain macrophages and microglia, serve as reservoirs of IFN-I resistant viruses, and explore whether SHIV-infected rhesus macaques recapitulate the IFN-I phenotypes of HIV-1 reservoir and rebound viruses. We expect these studies to improve our understanding of the clinically relevant, rebound competent HIV-1 reservoir, the mechanisms underlying in vivo viral reactivation and the host factors that place pressure on the rebounding virus pool, which should lead to more rational and effective HIV/AIDS cure strategies. .",5,5R01AI162646-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

During the previous funding period, the Bjorkman lab used novel design strategies to develop HIV-1 envelope (envelope) trimer-based immunogens to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against single and multiple epitopes, including the V3 glycan patch, CD4 binding site (CD4 binding site), and triple V3/CD4 binding site/V1V2 targets. In publications among the 32 supported by the current HIVRAD, the Bjorkman and Nussenzweig labs were the first to show that sequential immunizations with multimerized immunogens on protein nanoparticles elicited heterologous neutralizing antibodies (antibodies) in inferred germline (inferred germline) mice, and more impressively, in wildtype (wildtype) animals with polyclonal Ab repertoires [mice, rabbits, and rhesus macaques (rhesus macaques)]. However, the elicited cross-neutralizing antibodies did not confer protection from heterologous viral challenge, due at least in part to increasing off-target responses following multiple boosts and the failure of the cross-neutralizing antibodies to affinity mature to achieve high potency, breadth, and durability. This led to the discovery by Nussenzweig of Ab feedback and epitope masking, which attenuate focused B cell responses, a concept now becoming entrenched in the HIV-1 vaccine field. The goal of this renewal application is to build on these fundamental discoveries and design more strategic and effective priming and boosting immunogens. To accomplish this, we added a third collaborating research team (Hahn/Shaw/Weissman) that brings expertise in the SHIV model of bNAb induction and mRNA immunogen design. We will gain unique synergies from these highly collaborative research teams as follows: Project 1 (Bjorkman) will design next-generation prime and boost immunogens based on structural and biophysical analyses of GL-targeted and lineage-based envelope-Ab recognition from Project 2; Project 2 (Hahn/Shaw/Weissman) will decipher molecular pathways of envelope-Ab coevolution shared among different SHIVinfected rhesus macaques that develop neutralization breadth as a ""molecular guide"" for novel lineage-based immunogen design in Project 1 and will test these new protein nanoparticle and mRNA vaccine platforms for immunogenicity and protection in rhesus macaques; and Project 3 (Nussenzweig) will delineate the impacts of Ab feedback, epitope masking, and T follicular helper (T follicular helper) cell repertoire on enhancing or attenuating on-target B cell responses. These projects will be enabled by a Protein Expression and Automated Assays Core A (Vielmetter) and an Administrative Core B (Bjorkman). Our hypothesis is that by incorporating lineage-based envelope ""immunotypes"" that elicited broadly neutralizing antibodies in SHIV infected rhesus macaques in novel nanoparticle and mRNA-LNP vaccine designs (Projects 1 and 2) and by modulating epitope masking and T follicular helper responses in germinal centers (Projects 1 and 3), we can develop new prime and boost immunogens that lead to neutralization breadth, potency, and durability in wildtype animals.

Compared to the rapid progresses in DNA and RNA sequencing technologies, characterization of the final and arguably most actionable element of the central dogma, protein, has lagged behind. The dynamic relationship between the genome of a cell and its proteome is poorly understood, reflecting multiple layers of transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulation. In particular, the complexity of the human proteome is greatly expanded by the ~400 different types of protein posttranslational modifications (posttranslational modifications). The various PTM events, either alone or in combination (i.e., ""cross-talk""), represent powerful mechanisms to modulate the function of a protein (e.g., activity, stability and localization), the collection of which convey information within the signaling network that underlies the complex traits in various pathophysiological conditions. However, because of many inherent technical difficulties associated with the analysis of protein posttranslational modifications (e.g., chemically diverse, unstable and low abundance), a complete description of the posttranslationally modified proteome of any given cells remains a daunting task. The overarching mission of our program is to:  develop cutting-edge quantitative proteomic approaches to systematically identify and characterize novel posttranslational modifications,  comprehensively interrogate the signaling events regulated by phosphorylation (mTOR pathways) and ADP-ribosylation (PTMs,  comprehensively interrogate the signaling events regulated by phosphorylation (mTOR pathways) and ADP-ribosylation), and  combine these systems biology approaches with classical biochemical, cell biology and animal experiments to decipher the molecular underpinnings of cell growth and stress responses that are controlled by these two important pathways. To accomplish these goals, we will leverage our preliminary results (including a large set of unique hits, reagents and methods), and center our efforts on the following six goals. First, we will develop innovative mass spectrometric technologies with dramatically improved performance for global, quantitative and site-specific analysis of novel posttranslational modifications. Second, we will investigate the role of IGFBP5 (a recently identified extracellular target of mTORC1) as a mediator of the ""non-cell autonomous"" function of mTORC1. Third, we will determine the role of EGR1 (a novel hit identified from our previous MS screen) as a master regulator of the mTORC1-dependent feedback loops. Fourth, we will generate a tissue-specific atlas of mTORC1 phosphorylation substrates, and in doing so, interrogate non-uniform effects of this important pathway on the physiology of different tissues. Fifth, we will develop a large-scale MS approach to site-specific characterization of the D/E-mono-ADP-ribosylated proteome, and finally we will develop a large-scale method to measure absolute protein PARylation stoichiometries. Together, these studies provide a comprehensive framework for the MS identification and functional characterization of posttranslational modifications events linked to cell growth control and stress responses.",5,5R35GM134883-05,PAR-17-094,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

In recent years, the ability to quantitatively study genotype-phenotype maps has been revolutionized by the development of multiplex assays of variant effect (MAVEs), which measure molecular phenotypes for thousands to millions of genotypic variants in parallel. MAVE is an umbrella term that includes massively parallel reporter assays for studies of DNA or RNA regulatory sequences, as well as deep mutational scanning assays of proteins or structural RNAs. The rapid adoption of MAVE techniques across multiple genomic disciplines has created an acute need for computational methods that can robustly and reproducibly infer quantitative genotypephenotype (genotypephenotype) maps from the large datasets that MAVEs produce. Here we propose a unified conceptual and computational framework for quantitatively modeling genotypephenotype maps from MAVE data. This proposal is motivated by our realization that accounting for the noise and nonlinearities that are omnipresent in MAVE experiments requires explicit modeling of both the MAVE measurement process and the genotypephenotype map of interest. This joint inference strategy is more computationally demanding than most MAVE analysis methods, but it is feasible using modern deep learning frameworks. Our extensive preliminary data show that this modeling strategy is able to recover high-precision genotypephenotype maps even in the presence of major confounding effects, and thus has the potential to benefit MAVE studies in multiple areas of genomics. Aim 1 will develop methods for modeling the measurement processes that arise in diverse MAVE experimental designs. Aim 2 will develop general methods for modeling genetic interactions within genotypephenotype maps, and will use these methods in conjunction with new experiments to elucidate the molecular mechanism of a recently approved drug that targets alternative mRNA splicing. Aim 3 will develop methods for inferring genotypephenotype maps that reflect biophysical models of gene regulation, including both thermodynamic (i.e., quasi-equilibrium) and kinetic (i.e., non-equilibrium steady-state) models. These methods will then be used, in conjunction with new MAVE experiments, to develop a biophysical model for how a pleiotropic transcription factor regulates gene expression throughout the Escherichia coli genome. Aim 4 will study and develop methods for treating gauge freedoms and sloppy modes in the above classes of models, thereby facilitating the comparison, interpretation, and exploration of inferred genotypephenotype maps. All of the computational techniques we develop will be incorporated into a robust and easyto-use Python package called MAVE-NN. We will benchmark MAVE-NN on a diverse array of MAVE datasets, including published datasets and data generated as part of this project. In all, this work will fill a major need in the analysis of MAVE experiments, yielding a robust, flexible, and scalable computational platform that will help accelerate the use of MAVEs for understanding the effects of human genetic variation at the genomic scale.",5,5R01HG011787-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE,11,8,7,0

Biomedical research has made substantial progress towards this goal by establishing molecular and genetic approaches for detecting alleles associated with parasite resistance and host health. Pursuing these alleles across many organisms, including humans, has revealed an underlying problem: an allele may strongly predict parasite resistance in one environment but not others, or against one parasite strain but not others. This context-dependence might explain why genomic surveys have rarely been able to identify alleles that consistently explain disease susceptibility in humans. In addition, there is immense genetic diversity for parasite resistance in host populations, and this diversity is not represented in the few inbred lab lines used to identify alleles in model organisms. Therefore, to gain a general understanding of the alleles that matter for parasite resistance, we must account for the genetic diversity and environmental complexity present in the natural settings in which hosts encounter their parasites. In the next five years, research in my lab will address this need by characterizing the genetic basis of parasite resistance across genetic and environmental contexts using diverse host and parasite genotypes sampled from nature. My lab group is well-positioned for this work: we have expertise in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and its most prevalent natural parasite, the microsporidia Nematocida parisii. This powerful model system enables us to quickly and cheaply perform highly replicated experiments and genomic analyses to examine genetic variants across contexts. Recent efforts to collect wild C. elegans isolates and parasite strains have provided us with the broad sampling of natural variation necessary for our goal. Here, I propose to 1) characterize the alleles that contribute to parasite resistance in natural populations using high-throughput phenotyping, genome-wide association surveys, and highresolution quantitative trait mapping based on public collections of fully-sequenced wild C. elegans genotypes (>300) and recombinant inbred lines based on multiple wild parents. I then propose to use experimental evolution, phenotype mapping, and transgenic host lines to: 2) evaluate the impact of parasite genotype on the expression of genetic variation for parasite resistance, and 3) examine the sensitivity of resistance alleles to relevant environmental variation, specifically in microbial diet and population density. This proposed work forms the foundation of my research program targeted at establishing general frameworks for identifying the diversity of alleles that can determine parasite resistance and evaluating their contribution to host health in real world settings.

Deep sequencing studies have revealed an incredible transcriptional heterogeneity of neuronal subtypes within populations previously thought to be homogeneous. Despite the discovery of such molecular heterogeneity, the functional and behavioral relevance of these recently genetically defined neuronal cell types is largely unknown. Our application addresses this gap in knowledge by focusing on the neuronal control of social behaviors. Social interactions, ranging from non-vocal communication to complex language to core behaviors such as courtship or aggression, are important for mental well-being and reproductive success. The neural circuits underpinning these diverse behaviors have been difficult to disentangle, with non-genetically targeted approaches yielding phenotypes in multiple behavioral domains. Here we propose to characterize how progesterone and estrogen receptor alpha expressing neurons (Pvl neurons) in the ventromedial hypothalamus ventrolateralis (ventromedial hypothalamus ventrolateralis) regulate social behaviors. Our deep sequencing studies reveal distinct neuronal cell types within the population of Pvl neurons, with one of them restricted exclusively to females. Using newly developed Cre and Flpo mouse strains that mark this female-restricted neuronal cell type within Pvl neurons, we will determine its activity (Specific Aim 1), behavioral function (Specific Aim 2), and functional connectivity (Specific Aim 3) as these relate to female social behaviors. Together, our studies will uncover the activity dynamics, function, and connectivity of a genetically defined neuronal cell type of Pvl neurons; in parallel, we will also characterize the complementary set of remaining Pvl neurons and test their participation ins social behaviors. Thus, our research aims to understand how genetically defined cellular heterogeneity within a neuronal population relates to functional specificity in the control of social behaviors, a critical issue in neuroscience. Health Relatedness: Diverse neurodegenerative conditions and mental illnesses manifest with devastating clinical symptoms as well as a range of deficits in social and emotional behaviors. Pvl neurons within the ventromedial hypothalamus ventrolateralis represent a critical hub that regulates diverse core, developmentally programmed social behaviors that differ between the sexes. Rare case reports of lesions in proximity to this region show dramatic alterations in social behaviors. Our studies therefore will provide new insights into fundamental questions in neuroscience, and they also have the potential to shed light on how dysfunction in pathways emanating from the ventromedial hypothalamus ventrolateralis alters social behavior in disease states.",5,5R01HD109519-03,PA-20-185,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,0,1,5,1

The focus of this application is astrocytes, a type of glia. Long considered simply the brain's glue, astrocytes are emerging as important regulators of neuronal function. Astrocytes are ubiquitous, highly branched cells that tile the entire central nervous system, making contacts with neurons and blood vessels, and serving diverse roles. Established roles include ion homeostasis, neurotransmitter clearance, synapse formation/removal, synaptic modulation and contributions to neurovascular coupling. Deciphering and exploiting the physiological roles of astrocytes in the brain is one of the major open questions in neuroscience. This R35 application seeks to exploit technical and conceptual advances made with R01, R21 and DP1 awards and combine them into a single nimble, long-term research program to systematically explore and comprehensively understand the fundamental biology of astrocytes within adult vertebrate intact neural circuits with the compass-driven goal of exploiting this information for advancing new therapies. In this context, we define dysfunction as astrocyte process withdrawal from synapses or altered astrocyte signaling, including trophic support, to synapses. Such dysfunctions would alter established astrocyte roles including neurotransmitter clearance, synapse regulation and maintenance. This in turn would alter the timing of synaptic transmission and microcircuit function, contribute to excitotoxicity and perhaps trigger synapse removal. By exploiting novel experimental tools and concepts generated as part of DP1 and R21 awards, and by applying them to the exemplar striatal microcircuitry studied as part of successive R01 awards, we will determine how astrocytes regulate intact neural microcircuits in vivo. We will test the overarching hypothesis that astrocytes represent a hitherto largely overlooked mechanism in neural circuit function and in neurological disorders. As part of these efforts, we will utilize, and if necessary develop, state-of-the-art tools for molecular, cellular and circuit levels of evaluation. As described herein, our long-term programmatic goal, therefore, is to deliver pivotal molecular, physiological and mechanistic insights on astrocyte contributions to brain function and disease, laying the groundwork for therapeutic advances to occur.

In recent years, these efforts have focused on the application of photoredox catalysis as a uniquely enabling paradigm in synthetic chemistry. The distinct features of photocatalysts, in particular their ability to readily effect single-electron transfers and thereby generate reactive open-shell radical species, have created new opportunities for reaction development, providing highly enabling, novel bond disconnections in synthetic sequences. An area in which the application of photoredox catalysis has been notably successful is metallaphotoredox catalysis, the combination of photocatalysis with transition-metal catalysis.

Studies of regeneration following tissue damage in a group of ~6 species have made considerable advances towards this goal by uncovering mechanisms that promote proliferation, fate specification, and new cell survival. Pursuing these mechanisms, however, has revealed an underlying problem: how tissue re-patterning is limited to provide functional restoration and the re-establishment of homeostasis without detrimental overgrowth. To understand how growth and patterning are limited, and conversely, how tissues regress controllably will require broadening the systems in which these phenomena are examined to include models of natural, cyclical and highly stereotyped re-growth and degeneration. One such system - seasonally breeding songbirds - offers an outstanding opportunity to test mechanistic hypotheses of growth and degeneration and how events and outcomes at molecular and cellular levels impact higherlevel anatomy and behavior. This lab makes use of two different songbird species: Gambel's white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leugophrys gambelli) and the domesticated canary (Serinus canaria domestica). Whitecrowned sparrows are advantageous in having dramatic cycles of seasonal degeneration and regeneration of the neural circuit that controls singing behavior; an extensive literature detailing their natural history; and high tractability for experimental analyses due to their natural abundance and robustness in the lab. Canary breeds, each having unique singing abilities and well-documented genetics, promise the ability to link historical selection for particular allelic variants to regenerative form and function, and plasticity at the level of individuals and populations. Exploiting the natural and dramatic degeneration-regeneration cycles in sparrows this proposal aims to determine how cell death: (i) influences generation of new cells to limit total growth of neural tissue and (ii) is finely tuned to prevent excessive degeneration of tissue and behavior while maintaining competency for a return to homeostasis and subsequent plasticity. Exploiting the tight genetic control imposed by breeders in selecting for exaggerated singing in canaries, the work aims to determine how diversification of behavior arose from modifications to the balance between degeneration and regeneration, and how genetic changes translate to cellular plasticity and emergence of novel behavior. Towards these goals, this program will use a highly integrative and complementary set of approaches - including pharmacological manipulations of intact neural circuits in freely behaving birds; classic cellular, molecular, and histological analyses; and stateof-the-art genomic approaches - to interrogate the cellular, molecular, and evolutionary mechanisms regulating tissue patterning and homeostasis.

As traditional single-cell omics omits critical phenotypic and spatial information, the Single-Cell Analysis core will provide with innovative approaches to accurately identify immune cell populations and their functionality in their spatial context. This will be achieved by providing a consistent and validated pipeline of multiple high-throughput omics approaches including, single-cell RNA sequencing, cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing, cytometry by time of flight, spatial transcriptomics, and mass imaging. Interpretation of these data and their integration between the individual Projects will require a consistent experimental design and sample acquisition, as well as a significant effort of bioinformaticians with expertise in the biology of aging, immunology, and single-cell analysis. The Specific Aims of the Single-cell Analysis Core are: 1) Provide a quality-controlled platform and custom reagents for the single-cell and spatial genomics assessment of senescent cells; 2) Provide bioinformatics and statistical analyses of single-cell and spatial omics datasets; and 3) Develop a database to warehouse, integrate, and share datasets.",1,1P01AI172501-01A1,PAR-22-225,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,11,8,2,0

There is a critical unmet need for imaging tools that accurately risk stratify atherosclerotic patients based on their inflammatory phenotype and identify those where a given therapy is indicated and then monitor its effect. The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 / C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (MCP-1/CCR2) axis is of particular interest due to its central role in recruitment of pro-inflammatory monocytes which through their conversion of pro-inflammatory macrophages are crucial for early atherosclerotic lesion formation and its progression. We have developed a copper-64 radiolabeled extracellular loop 1 inverso (extracellular loop 1 inverso) peptide PET radiotracer that targets CCR2 ([64Cu]DOTA-extracellular loop 1 inverso). We have shown this radiotracer provides sensitive and specific detection of CCR2 receptor expression in a human monocytic cell line and ex-vivo human peripheral arterial atherosclerotic plaque and tracks disease progression and treatment response in pre-clinical atherosclerotic models. Moreover, we have initial human subject PET data to suggest [64Cu]DOTA-extracellular loop 1 inverso noninvasively detects atherosclerotic lesions. Our objective is to perform the initial evaluation of the imaging performance of [64Cu]DOTA-extracellular loop 1 inverso in humans with peripheral carotid and femoral arterial atherosclerosis and obtain key biological information that is foundational for the design of future studies to assess its capability for diagnosis, prognosis assignment and evaluation of new therapies. To achieve this objective we will address, in parallel, the following Aims: Aim 1. Evaluate the performance of [64Cu]DOTA-extracellular loop 1 inverso PET/MR to detect CCR2+ monocytes and macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques from patients undergoing carotid or femoral endarterectomy (CEA and FEA): In Aim 1A we will evaluate the imaging characteristics of [64Cu]DOTA-extracellular loop 1 inverso in normal volunteers (Group 1) and in patients undergoing CEA (Group 2) or FEA (Group 3). Imaging performance will be determined by correlation with standard MR readouts of plaque presence, size and stage and with ex-vivo tissue measurements of CCR2 content/expression and inflammation determined by autoradiography and molecular profiling assays. As an exploratory Aim we will assess the relationship between hematopoiesis and atherosclerotic plaque progression. In Aim 1B we will determine the reproducibility of this approach in patients with carotid and femoral artery atherosclerotic occlusive disease managed non-operatively. Aim 2. Determine in ex-vivo human atherosclerotic CEA and FEA plaque samples the relationship between [64Cu]DOTA-extracellular loop 1 inverso binding, CCR2+ cellular expression, immune cell composition, cytokine expression and plaque complexity. Atheromas are often heterogeneous with areas of variable intraplaque calcification, hemorrhage, and inflammation. We will define lesion types with variable [64Cu]DOTA-extracellular loop 1 inverso signal and characterize their cellular and molecular composition using autoradiography, multiplex immunohistochemistry and spatial transcriptomics. As an exploratory analysis, we will correlate findings from Aims 1A and 2A with known co-morbidities and risk factors for peripheral arterial atherosclerosis to determine if there are specific patient populations that are more likely to have higher or lower CCR2 plaque content. Successful completion of the proposed research will permit delineation of the importance of CCR2 expression in human atherosclerosis, particularly involving sites that are relatively understudied such as peripheral arterial disease. These results will lay the foundation for larger seminal multi-center studies to assess our imaging approach to noninvasively detect CCR2 expressing cells in human atherosclerosis.",5,5R01HL150891-05,PA-19-056,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",14,8,7,1

Key challenges and opportunities lie in linking genomic variants to phenotypes, human health, and disease. Because it is not feasible to experimentally probe all genomic variants of interest in all contexts, improved computational methods to accurately predict the impact of unknown genomic variants are necessary. The aim of this research proposal is to gain mechanistic understanding of functional genomic interactions and ultimately to develop computational approaches to model and predict relationships among variation, functional elements, genome function, and phenotype. Two recently acquired key assets will be used to infer distal functional interactions among DNA elements: i) 3D genomics data and ii) multiple genome alignments. Highresolution contact mapping experiments (Hi-C and similar methods) have shown that the structural ensembles of chromosomes are fluid and yet specific to cell type and phase of life1. These ensembles of partially organized structures bring sections of DNA separated by great genomic distance into close spatial proximity and play an important role in controlling gene transcription 2,3. By measuring the frequency of physical contacts among DNA elements, DNA-DNA proximity ligation assays offer insight into the existence of functional interactions among the same elements, even when the nature of the interaction is unknown. In the last few years, there has been an explosion of activity directed toward assembling the genomes of many species 35-37. Hundreds of newly assembled end-to-end genomes constitute a dataset of transformative importance in studying the general operating principles of genomes across the tree of life using evolutionary information. This proposal aims to combine data from proximity ligation assays and coevolutionary information extracted from multiple genome alignments to infer the network of functional interactions among DNA elements. The computational approach will be based on Direct Coupling Analysis 29-32 (Direct Coupling Analysis 29-32) and other machine learning methods. The PI has previously employed Direct Coupling Analysis 29-32 to study genome architecture 33 as well as in other contexts 34, and has already made important contributions to the field of 3D genomics.",5,5R35GM146852-03,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,11,8,2,0

Ovarian cancer symptoms are vague and nonspecific, and current screening is generally not effective. Because ovarian cancer is so deadly, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy) is often recommended for women at high risk; however, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy has fertility and health consequences. It is now believed that ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (high-grade serous carcinoma) may begin in the fallopian tubes (fallopian tubes) as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma), and that precancerous changes are detectable before metastasis to the ovary and peritoneal cavity occurs. Our preliminary data indicate that there are significant changes in serum protein biomarkers in high-grade serous carcinoma cases 12-84 months prior to diagnosis. Further, we have also shown that changes occur in multispectral fluorescence image markers of normal and cancerous ovaries and fallopian tubes, and that we can build a thin falloposcope suitable for traversing the uterus and FT for imaging and cell collection. We will address the unmet clinical need for a minimally invasive test for serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma and early (stage I/II) ovarian cancer. Currently, no methods enable the detection of ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma with a lead time of more than 12 months. Overall, our work will meet the need to detect aggressive cancers at the earliest possible stage. Our initial target population is women at high risk for ovarian cancer who wish to delay or avoid risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. We will combine blood screening for protein markers with a minimally invasive falloposcopy for optical imaging and FT cell collection. Our procedure will be tested in a study of women at high risk undergoing bilateral salpingooophorectomy with hysterectomy, which will enable us to obtain and compare test results to gold standard histology. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop and validate biomarkers that detect serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma and early epithelial ovarian cancer. We will improve upon our existing cut-off based algorithm with newly-discovered markers as well develop a velocity-based biomarker algorithm. The algorithm that detects disease 12-84 months prior to diagnosis will be confirmed in an independent, blinded set of clinical blood samples. 2) Develop endoscopic imaging and pathomics markers. We will improve our prototype falloposcope system with higher resolution multispectral imaging and improved cell collection ability. We will develop imaging and karyometric markers from the FT images and the cells collected, and perform a pilot in vivo study. 3) Develop an actionable clinical strategy for early detection of epithelial ovarian cancer. A study will be performed in women at high risk who are planning a risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. Those who test positive from our blood test developed in Specific Aim 1 will have their tissue undergo a falloposcopy. Imaging and pathomics data will be used to develop a classifier, which will be compared to gold standard histology findings of normal FT, serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, or occult high-grade serous carcinoma.",5,5R01CA260399-03,PAR-19-264,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,17,0,4,4

Despite early-stage clinical progress for CRISPR-Cas based approaches, monogenic neurodegenerative conditions and nucleotide triplet expansion disorders have not been a focus of any biotechnology company in this space. Our proposal brings together a team of academic investigators to develop a synergistic suite of first-in-class CRISPR-Cas based therapeutics for Huntington's disease (Huntington's disease) and C9ORF72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). We will engineer and deploy an editing approach that excises, with IND-grade potency and mutant allele-selectivity, the diseasecausing expansion repeat from human HTT and C9ORF72 loci, respectively. Our strategy is based on identifying alleles of commonly heterozygous SNPs that reside on the same haplotype as the disease-causing repeat expansion, and then engineering CRISPR-Cas9 for high selectivity of cleavage, on one or both sides of the mutant allele repeat, to drive its excision, with two tiers of delivery innovation. Our trailblazer Project 1, RP1 (Research Project 1, RP1) will develop an Huntington's disease therapeutic by packaging mutant HTT-specific CRISPR-Cas9 into a newly developed serotype of adeno-associated virus (adeno-associated virus) with robust and broad biodistribution in the brain parenchyma of nonhuman primates (nonhuman primates). We will implement an innovative strategy in which the CRISPR-Cas9 cassette temporally limits its own expression. We will identify and advance the preclinical lead composition through IND-enabling studies leveraging 3 dedicated Resource Cores to (i) assess molecular outcomes at the genetic level, (ii) administer reagents to animals and observe their behavior, and (iii) assess molecular and histological outcomes from cells and animal tissues. An Administrative Core led by experienced developers of genome editing-based therapeutics, will provide Project 1, RP1-management support and lead on preparation of regulatory submissions, aiming to file an Huntington's disease IND by program end. In RP2, we will apply the adeno-associated virus-based excision approach to build a cognate experimental therapeutic for C9ORF72-driven amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Synergies with RP1 include CMC innovation to manufacture novel adeno-associated virus, re-use of the self-regulating CRISPR-Cas cassette and virus harboring it, and regulatory feedback on IND-enabling pharmacology, toxicology, and biodistribution studies. We will advance RP2 through pre-IND. For RP3, we will establish a first-in-class, transformative paradigm for in vivo genome editing therapy by reformulating the preclinical lead CRISPR-Cas9 combination used in RP1 into a highly innovative ""Cas9 RNP monoparticle"" in which amphiphilic peptides deliver the gene editor to neurons upon injection. We will develop approaches for monoparticle manufacture to enable ex vivo and in vivo efficacy studies in Huntington's disease models. Extensive synergies with RP1 Project 1, RP1 and comprehensive support by the RCs will enable us to advance this approach to pre-IND by program end.

Homeostatic behaviors like feeding and food preferences are prime examples of genetic predispositions interacting with the food environment to produce diverse feeding habits. However, these programs are further modified by host-associated microbes, suggesting the overall systems controlling behavioral phenotype is far more complex than first anticipated. The critical questions that remain to be addressed are: to what extent do host-microbe interactions contribute to individual differences in behavior? Specifically, how does gene regulation of behavior operate in the context of host-microbe symbiosis? Implicit in this question is the hypothesis that perturbation of host-microbe symbiosis results in aberrant behavioral outcomes in certain individuals or populations, a topic fundamental to human health yet unsolved. The goal of my research program is to define how behaviors are shaped by host-microbe interactions. My lab studies foraging and food choice behaviors in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, using a gnotobiotic system I developed that permits precise configuration of the fly microbiome. I hypothesize that feeding behavior and food preferences are the product of host genetics-microbiome interactions, which determine, in part, an individual's long-term health. Our recent data show that foraging and diet selection preferences vary by the microbiome, and altering the microbiome triggers transcriptional changes in specific cell clusters within the fly brain, involving genes predicted to affect behavior. In this five-year plan, I will leverage fly genetics and stateof-the-art genomics and metabolomics tools to identify the gene regulatory networks and mechanisms underlying microbial modulation of host behavior. Expected outcomes include comprehensive gut endocrine signaling and inter-organ communication maps at single-cell transcriptome scale and metabolite-gene interactions networks. The causal effects of microbiome-responsive genes, neuropeptides, and metabolites on host feeding behavior and food preferences will be revealed. Since we know little about how the interplay of host genetics and microbiome contribute to complex behavior, my research has the potential to advance fundamental knowledge in behavioral genetics but also to identify genes or processes that may function similarly in Drosophila and mammals as targets to treat behavioral disorders, such as eating disorders and obesity.",5,5R35GM147651-03,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,3,9,1,3

Understanding the mechanisms of neural circuit assembly may provide insights into the etiology of human brain disorders. The fruit fly olfactory circuit has been an excellent model to investigate the mechanisms by which wiring specificity of neural circuits arises during development. In this circuit, axons of 50 types of olfactory receptor neurons (olfactory receptor neurons) match precisely with dendrites of 50 corresponding types of second-order olfactory projection neurons (projection neurons), forming 50 discrete glomeruli in the antennal lobe. This allows olfactory information to be faithfully delivered from peripheral sensory organs to higher brain centers, enabling innate and learned olfactory behavior. Thanks to the continual support of this grant since 2003, our studies have made the Drosophila antennal lobe one of the best-understood circuits in the molecular, cellular, and developmental underpinnings of wiring specificity. During the last grant cycle, we made three key advances: 1) we determined single-cell transcriptomes of projection neurons and olfactory receptor neurons across development, which have produced differentially expressed genes as candidate wiring molecules and cell-type-specific drivers for labelling and genetically manipulating individual PN and ORN types; 2) we developed a cell-surface proteomic profiling method that allowed us to identify new wiring molecules; 3) we established an explant culture that recapitulates wiring specificity in vivo, allowing us to examine the dynamic process of circuit assembly in wild-type and mutants using time-lapse imaging. In this proposal, we will take advantage of these advances to further investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the olfactory circuit is assembled and wiring specificity is achieved. Specifically, we will utilize new genetic tools and time-lapse imaging to determine the cellular events that lead to PN dendrite patterning, segregation, and ORN-PN synaptic partner matching. We will investigate the mechanisms by which cell surface receptor teneurins work with putative ligands and downstream signaling molecules to instruct synaptic partner matching. We will also identify additional instructive wiring molecules and study their mechanisms of actions using data from single-cell transcriptomes and in vivo assays that can distinguish attraction vs. repulsion in ligand-receptor interactions.",5,5R01DC005982-22,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,0,1,5,1

Despite the substantial progress made on this question in recent years, many key knowledge gaps remain. These gaps not only prevent us from leveraging underlying mechanisms to induce antigen-specific immune tolerance in the clinical arena, but also limit investigation into the pathogenesis of intrauterine growth restriction, spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia, and preterm labor, i.e., pregnancy complications that may all involve aberrant activation of the maternal immune system to placental antigens. Recently, our laboratory has described key roles for B cell-mediated antigen presentation and antigen glycosylation in suppressing immune responses to placental antigens in mice. Specifically, we found that a surrogate model antigen expressed by trophoblasts (t-mOVA) is presented to maternal CD4 T cells exclusively by antigen-specific B cells, and that these B cells are suppressed through the actions of t-mOVA's heavily sialylated N-linked glycans, thus in turn suppressing the CD4 T cells. This major new line of investigation raises immediate questions that we address in this proposal. Specifically, Aim 1 will use both mouse (t-mOVA) and human models to evaluate the hypothesis that glycan-specific IgM natural antibodies bind to antigens shed from the placenta, activating complement and thus causing the antigens to accumulate on follicular dendritic cells in the spleen. This accumulation in turn allows the antigens' glycans to suppress antigen-specific B cells. Substantiation of this pathway would suggest new ways to conceptualize the pathogenesis of human pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia that are linked to increased antibody and complement deposition on trophoblast membranes. Aim 2 then seeks to the determine the features of trophoblast glycans that impart them with immunosuppressive properties, which, together with Aim 1, would inform how best to harness trophoblast glycobiology for therapeutic purposes. It will employ a variety of techniques including mass spectrometry to define the structures of t-mOVA's glycans, and will fingerprint the glycans that decorate human syncytiotrophoblast brush border membrane proteins bathed in maternal blood. Lastly, Aim 3 will address the behavior of the tissue resident memory T cells that populate the decidua. These cells are positioned to defend against congenital infection but also pose potential direct threats to fetal survival. Using mouse models, it will determine the responsiveness of the cells to trophoblast antigens, as well as whether they are suppressed by trophoblast antigen-associated glycans, like B and T cells are systemically. Together, we expect this work to have a major impact on the field as it begins to connect the discovery that glycans play a central role in fetomaternal tolerance with other critical questions in reproductive immunology and obstetrics. The work will also further a second long-term goal of the fetomaternal tolerance field, namely, to foster application of underlying mechanisms to immune tolerance induction in the clinical arena.",1,1R01AI184482-01,RFA-AI-23-027,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,1,3,3,2

Many recent advances in Evo-Devo have identified genetic changes that are associated with the acquisition of, or changes in, external body features, such as alterations in pigmentation patterns or development of body armor. In contrast, our studies are novel in this field as they have revealed unexpected genetic variation underlying a highly conserved trait: the shared segmented body plan of insects. The genes controlling segmentation encode transcription factors that are required for embryonic development and viability. The cohort of genes responsible for segment formation include pair-rule genes (pair-rule genes) identified in the model insect Drosophila. Mutations in Drosophila pair-rule genes result in lethality accompanied by loss of alternate segmental regions. Thus, it was surprising to find differences in the presence, expression, or function of pair-rule genes in different insect taxa. The work proposed here is designed to understand the mechanistic basis for this genetic variation, which we have observed in different insect lineages. To carry out functional studies, we have developed molecular genetic approaches in diverse insect species in our lab. The establishment of multiple non-model systems simultaneously within one lab has synergistic effects due to sharing of protocols and troubleshooting strategies, allowing us to develop new techniques more effectively in different species. With these tools in hand, we will examine the underlying bases of specific scenarios of genetic variation: In Aim 1, we will ask how PR-patterning is achieved without canonical pair-rule genes in the milkweed bug Oncopeltus where we have found novel utilization of pair-rule genes compared to Drosophila. Aim 2 will explore the evolutionary trajectory of the Oncopeltus PRG network across insect groups. Aim 3 will decipher mechanisms underlying loss of an essential PRG in both mosquitoes and butterflies. These studies will contribute to our understanding of fundamental mechanisms regulating embryonic development and how these mechanisms have changed during the radiation of insects. This project will train postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and at least five undergraduate students in molecular biology, genetics, and molecular evolution. Establishment of molecular techniques in non-model and emerging model insect species, including expression analysis, RNA interference, CRISPR/Cas9, FAIRE-seq, and transgenesis, not only allows us to answer fundamental questions about embryonic development, but also provides molecular tools for translational studies of insects that pose a risk to human health.",5,5R01GM113230-10,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,11,10,2,0

Recent technological advances in high-throughput phenotyping assays for model organisms and the establishment of large human biobanks and consortium databases have provided opportunities to study the genotype-phenotype maps for complex traits in unprecedented detail. However, it remains a major challenge to model and interpret these data due to the intrinsic high dimensionality of the genotype space and the many ways in which causal genes can interact. My research program is focused on developing new theoretical frameworks and interpretable computational tools to analyze large genotypephenotype datasets with the goal of  accurately predicting phenotypes for novel genotypes and  providing biological insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits by identifying key genes, gene interactions, and pathways. The primary focus for my lab in the next five years is to develop new Bayesian and machine learning methods capable of modeling the full spectrum of genetic interactions including pairwise as well as higher-order epistasis. Specifically, we are combining rigorous mathematical modeling with modern machine learning techniques to develop a suite of scalable, principled methods to achieve accurate phenotypic prediction and accelerate the discovery of novel genetic mechanisms. While proof-of-concept versions of many of the proposed methods display state-ofthe-art performance, substantial work remains to scale the methods to larger genotype-phenotype datasets, test model performance on a wide range of complex traits and organisms, and interpret the results to gain biological insights. In the coming years, we plan to build these methods into an integrated framework for analyzing complex genetic interactions, which will include computational pipelines for fitting accurate phenotypic prediction models, identifying gene interactions and pathways for experimental validation, and quantification of estimation uncertainty. We will also prioritize the development of user-friendly, GPU-accelerated software packages for all methods. Important applications of the proposed research directions include predicting disease risks in humans, elucidating the genetic mechanisms for economically and clinically important traits, and designing improved plant and animal breeding programs.

Such control mechanisms are critical for maintaining genome integrity because premature transition from one stage to the next stage of the cell cycle can lead to aneuploidy and, hence, cell death. Four major cell cycle transition points, the G1/S transition, the G2/M transition, the metaphase/anaphase transition, and the mitosis/cytokinesis transition, are under stringent control, but how they are regulated at the molecular level in T. brucei, a protozoan parasite and the causative agent of human sleeping sickness, remains poorly understood. Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cyclin-dependent kinases) are key regulators of the cell cycle transitions in eukaryotes, and T. brucei employs the CDK-related kinase CRK1 to control the G1/S transition, CRK2 to promote S-phase progression, and CRK3 to govern the G2/M transition. The roles of CRK1 in controlling the nuclear events in promoting the G1/S transition and the role of CRK2 in regulating S-phase progression have been recently revealed by us. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the G2/M transition and the metaphase/anaphase transition are still elusive. Further, it is generally accepted that T. brucei lacks several cell cycle checkpoints, including the spindle assembly checkpoint, and it is unclear how T. brucei recognizes the genomic errors occurred during the cell cycle and prevents erroneous genome duplication and premature genome segregation. Our recent discovery of a novel DNA damageinduced metaphase checkpoint suggests a kinetochore-based checkpoint machinery in T. brucei, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. The current proposal aims to understand the control of the G2/M transition by CRK3-mediated regulation of the chromosomal passenger complex, the control of metaphase/anaphase transition by CRK3-mediated regulation of kinetochore proteins, and the mechanism of the metaphase checkpoint mediated by KKIP5 and its associated proteins.

Decreases in body (systemic) hydration, cause systemic vocal fold dehydration. Systemic vocal fold dehydration alters the biology of the tissue. Nevertheless, the importance of estrogens in regulating these biological changes of systemic vocal fold dehydration remain unknown. We address this important clinical and theoretical issue by investigating the transcriptome, proteome, tissue morphology, and ultrasonic vocalization outcomes in a study design that carefully manipulates hormonal state and hydration state. We will also examine the effects of estrogen on the vascular geometry and blood flow to the larynx following the interaction of systemic dehydration with altered hormonal states. We use the rat animal model for these studies since this model allows for robust and rigorous control of hydration and hormonal levels. Because estrogen is important irrespective of biological sex, both male and female rats will be included. To examine the effects of hormonal loss and replacement, we will measure outcomes when reproductive organs have been surgically removed (ovariectomized and orchiectomized rats) and when estrogen replacement with estradiol is delivered. Systemic dehydration will be induced by a translational paradigm of water restriction for 5 days. Animals with free access to water will serve as controls for dehydration. Across 16 animal groups, our first goal is to quantify the effects of hormonal loss on the molecular and histologic signatures of vocal fold dehydration and the influence of estradiol replacement on these signatures. Because hormone receptors are differentially located across vocal fold mucosa and muscle, and these tissue layers have distinct cellular organization and biomechanical properties, the vocal fold mucosa and muscle are examined separately. Our second goal is to investigate the interaction of hormonal status and dehydration on ultrasonic vocalizations. Our third goal is to examine the influence of hormonal status and dehydration on vascular geometry, blood flow, and the physiologic consequences of these changes. By combining molecular, histological, and functional studies, and mechanistic investigations of hemodynamic modifications, this comprehensive proposal seeks to shed fundamental insight into the effects of estrogens on vocal fold dehydration biology.

During the past 5 years (2013 to 2018), research by Cheng and co-workers has pushed the boundary of vibrational spectroscopic imaging in terms of speed, spectral bandwidth, imaging depth, and detection sensitivity (for a review, Science, 2015, 350: aaa8870). In parallel, via collaborations, Cheng and co-workers discovered significant metabolic signatures defining cancer aggressiveness (Cell Metabolism 2014), cancer cell stemness (Cell Stem Cell 2017), and antimicrobial resistance (Anal Chem 2017), as well as a spectroscopic indicator of membrane voltage in neurons (JPC Lett 2017). The overarching goal of this MIRA proposal is to further push the boundary of nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic imaging platforms in order to unveil the signatures that underlie initiation or progression of human diseases by ""watching the orchestra of molecules"" in real space and time inside a living system. Cheng and co-workers will pursue this goal by advancing the capability of two complimentary vibrational imaging platforms, namely multiplex stimulated Raman scattering microscopy and infrared photothermal microscopy both invented in the Cheng lab, to reach single-molecule detection sensitivity, 100-nm spatial resolution, volumetric mapping at high speed, and deep-tissue penetration. As a focused application, the team will deploy the developed technologies to advance the basic understanding of how a biological cell reprograms its metabolism during development in vivo or in response to a stress.",5,5R35GM136223-05,PAR-17-094,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,11,8,2,0

Indeed, adults with traumatic spinal cord injuries maintain chronic functional deficits that impact all aspects of their lives. However, increasing evidence suggests that the adult CNS retains some ability to initiate a growth program and functionally re-organize in response to activity, experience and mild trauma and particularly after intensive rehabilitative therapy. In this proposal we have used in vivo viral tracing in combination with FACS and single cell RNA sequencing to develop a comprehensive anatomical and molecular atlas of the adult corticospinal tract (corticospinal tract). We plan to leverage this atlas to define the molecular mechanisms that drive axon growth in specific subsets of corticospinal tract neurons during rehab in the presence and absence of the axon growth inhibitors nogo receptor-1. We believe that a comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic molecular mechanism that initiates and sustains rehab-mediated axon growth within defined subsets of corticospinal tract neurons can then be exploited to design novel therapies to repair the acutely and chronically damaged spinal cord.",5,5R01NS121026-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,2,13,5,1

Increasing our understanding of basic biology of the blood-brain barrier is essential to improving existing therapies and finding new methods of targeting drugs to the brain. Previous work has found tight temporal regulation of the blood-brain barrier by the molecular clock is necessary for efficient transport of xenobiotics from the brain; however, there has not been systemic characterization of the particles that are clock regulated nor do we have a good understanding of the regulation of this clock. We propose to characterize a robustly oscillating human blood-brain barrier model using clonal human brain microvascular endothelial cells (brain microvascular endothelial cells) with a circadian rhythm reporter and co-culture primary human astrocytes, pericytes and/or neurons in a 2D system. We hypothesize that secreted factors from pericytes and neurons are required for robust brain microvascular endothelial cells rhythms, which regulate temporal gating of nutrients and proinflammatory cytokines. First, we will determine molecular and cellular components required for robust brain microvascular endothelial cell oscillation and the clockdependent molecular trafficking through the blood-brain barrier. Second, we will study the bidirectional effects of peripheral inflammation and blood-brain barrier circadian rhythms. Ultimately, understanding timing of molecular trafficking through the blood-brain barrier may provide candidate serum targets for chronomedicine and neurobiological treatments as well as generate insight into blood-effects on the brain.",1,1R21NS132010-01A1,PA-21-219,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,2,6,6,1

Unfortunately, many children with cerebral palsy (cerebral palsy), the most common cause of pediatric physical disability, have difficulty walking and completing higher-intensity ambulatory tasks. This leads to children with cerebral palsy engaging in levels of habitual physical activity that are well below guidelines and those of children without disabilities, which in turn contributes to many secondary conditions, including metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. There is broad clinical consensus that plantarflexor dysfunction is a primary contributor to slow, inefficient, and crouched walking patterns in cerebral palsy; individuals with cerebral palsy need more effective treatments and mobility aids for plantarflexor dysfunction. To meet this need, this proposal aims to evaluate a holistic strategy to address impaired mobility from plantarflexor dysfunction in cerebral palsy using a lightweight, dual-mode (assistive or resistive) wearable robotic device. This strategy combines two complementary techniques:  targeted ankle resistance for neuromuscular gait training that provides precision therapy to elicit long-term improvements in ankle muscle function, and  adaptive ankle assistance to make walking easier during sustained, high-intensity, or challenging tasks. The first specific aim is to quantify improvement in ankle muscle function and functional mobility following targeted ankle resistance gait training in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy. The primary hypothesis for the first aim is that targeted ankle resistance training will produce larger improvements in lower-extremity motor control, gait mechanics, and clinical measures of mobility assessed fourand twelve-weeks post intervention compared to standard physical therapy and standard gait training. The second specific aim is to determine the efficacy of adaptive ankle assistance to improve capacity and performance during sustained, high-intensity, and challenging tasks in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy. The primary hypothesis for the second aim is that adaptive ankle assistance will result in significantly greater capacity and performance during the six-minute-walk-test and graded treadmill and stair stepping protocols compared to walking with ankle foot orthoses and walking with just shoes. Both Specific Aims will explore the participant characteristics (e.g., age, gender, GMFCS level, walking speed, spasticity rating) that are associated with the greatest improvement in outcomes following each intervention to provide guidance for future clinical and at-home implementation. The proposed studies will establish fundamental knowledge on the ability for adaptive ankle interventions to treat walking impairment relative to standard of care in cerebral palsy.",5,5R01HD107277-04,PA-18-480,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,0,1,5,1

Transfusions remain a cornerstone treatment for patients with sickle cell disease, but unlike other transfused patient populations, a higher proportion (20-50%) of patients with sickle cell disease develop alloantibodies with potentially life-threatening sequalae. These include poorly understood delayed transfusion reactions (DHTRs) whose occurrence, as well as clinical progression from mild to severe, is unpredictable. A long-standing interest of our research program has been to understand the underling immune mechanisms leading to sickle cell disease complications including vaso-occlusion crisis and transfusion complications. Our studies have uncovered an underappreciate role of circulating monocytes and the innate immune response to hemolysis, a hallmark of sickle cell disease, in transfusion complications including alloimmunization and DHTRs. Our projected studies as part of this R35 will be focused on innate immune cellular pathways that magnify the inflammatory sickle cell disease state versus the cells' heme protective pathways such as the heme detoxifying key enzyme heme oxygenase 1 in alloimmunization and in the development of DHTRs. Our laboratory has also identified a novel function for a subset of circulating monocytes, referred to as patrolling monocytes (patrolling monocytes), in their ability to scavenge and remove damaged endothelium and endothelial-attached sickle RBCs. The discovery of a novel mechanism of action of patrolling monocytes in sickle cell disease offers a paradigm shift in our understanding of vaso-occlusion crisis and opens up the possibility that patrolling monocytess can be manipulated to prevent painful vaso-occlusion crisis. An objective of the proposed studies in this R35 is to understand the mechanisms by which patrolling monocytes protect sickle cell disease vasculature and how they are affected both functionally and numerically during a vaso-occlusive event with the goal to help establish their role in vaso-occlusion crisis pathophysiology, and their potential as a therapeutic target for vaso-occlusion crisis. As we have done in the past, all the proposed studies for both objectives will combine the use of in vivo mouse models, in vitro human model systems, and patient samples to mechanistically dissect in a rigorous manner how specific immune cell types and molecular pathways contribute to sickle cell disease alloimmunization and vaso-occlusion crisis. Altogether, we believe that our laboratory's approach of integrating studies in humans and experimental models to mechanistically dissect immune pathways that regulate sickle cell disease complications is likely to be impactful and generate novel findings in areas critical to the NHLBI scientific mission.",5,5R35HL161239-03,RFA-HL-20-011,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",3,4,0,3

Although the identification of inflammatory triggers has been identified as a critical area for aging research, little attention has focused on the skin, despite its role as a primary immunoregulatory organ. Normal aging is associated with increased skin barrier permeability, which leads to subclinical inflammatory cascades in the skin and serum. We hypothesize that age-associated decline of skin barrier function contributes to inflammageing and that restoring the skin barrier with moisturizers will reduce systemic inflammation. We propose a pilot trial designed to determine the best measures of skin barrier function in older adults, the most sensitive measures of systemic inflammation, the role of the cutaneous microbiome, and the feasibility and acceptability of moisturizer use. In a parallel, 8-week, self-controlled design, 32 subjects ≥70 years of age will be randomized to treatment with a ceramide moisturizing cream or petrolatum ointment. Changes in inflammatory markers, skin barrier function, and microbial diversity will be compared between a 4-week treatment period of moisturizer application and a 4-week placebo period. We will also examine recruitment efficacy, retention rates, fidelity to the treatment, data integrity, and the acceptability of the intervention and protocol. The results will be used to design a future randomized efficacy trial of moisturizers to reduce systemic inflammation.

Perturbations in enhancer sequence or regulation can lead to disease, including congenital malformations and cancer. Furthermore, enhancer sequence divergence is emerging as an important mediator of human phenotypic variation. Key features of enhancers include their role as major sites for transcription factor (transcription factor) and coactivator binding in the genome, as well as their ability to activate transcription over long genomic distances from their target promoters. Indeed, at some genomic loci enhancers can regulate promotes at distances of over a megabase away. Such long-range function raises a question of how is regulatory specificity within chromosomal domains containing many cis-regulatory elements accomplished to allow for precise and robust gene regulation during development and in tissue homeostasis? Proposed research program focuses on addressing fundamental knowledge gaps in enhancer biology and longrange gene regulation. We will utilize novel genomic and computational approaches to systematically probe how enhancer-promoter genomic distance, 3D contacts and inherent features of cis-regulatory elements influence transcriptional outputs, and how a broader genomic and epigenomic environment modulates promoter responsiveness to enhancers. We will complement these studies with live-cell and multiplexed DNA FISH imaging of model loci where enhancers regulate their target genes over ultra-long genomic distances. We will track movement of cis-regulatory elements and visualize nascent transcripts to capture the kinetic behavior of enhancers and promoters and its relationship with the discontinuous nature of transcription. We will introduce genetic perturbations to address how a new class of structural elements identified in our previous studies mediates robust transcriptional regulation. Finally, through precise modulation of transcription factor and coactivator dosage at physiological levels, we will explore features that confer sensitivity or robustness of enhancers and gene expression to changes in trans-activator concentrations.

Some 37.3 million Americans have type 2 diabetes and significant racial and socioeconomic disparities persist in care quality and patient safety. federally qualified health centers serve 1 in 7 U.S. racial/ethnic minorities and shoulder a higher prevalence of diabetes (21% FQHC, 11% U.S.), offering a promising venue for innovating in equity-focused diabetes care. The iPATH project will refine and implement an approach to practice transformation originally conceived to support federally qualified health centers' pursuit of National Committee for Quality Assurance recognition as patient-centered medical homes. A pilot demonstrated significant decreases (average 31% reduction) in poorly controlled diabetes (A1c>9%) among patients at 7 clinics affiliated with an FQHC in Puerto Rico in 2017-20. Improvements in patients' diabetes control were sustained preto postCovid-19 pandemic. Aim 1. Refine the iPATH implementation approach by identifying organizational conditions and processes at federally qualified health centers that promoted or impeded the effectiveness of type 2 diabetes care for NIHdesignated U.S. health disparity populations preand post-pandemic. Research teams will simultaneously conduct 12 in-depth regional case studies, enabling contrast between federally qualified health centers considered highperforming and low-performing for diabetes control. Teams will identify actionable, how-to implementation factors for ensuring chronic, preventive, and acute care for patients with diabetes. Employing an innovative Rapid Data Collection and Reporting methodology, teams will rapidly collect, analyze, and share data to accelerate dissemination of customized feedback to FQHC leaders and to inform adaptation and implementation of the iPATH practice transformation. Aim 2. Implement a multi-level, multi-component, technology-enabled practice transformation strategy to improve type 2 diabetes for patients at 8 multi-clinic federally qualified health centers. Teams will adapt, tailor, implement, test, and spread an equity-focused practice transformation strategy across federally qualified health centers located in California, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Puerto Rico. The iPATH implementation approach will be modularized and customizable to accommodate organizational readiness, patient needs, and social contexts, tailoring practice transformation efforts to each unique FQHC. Aim 3. Comprehensively evaluate the iPATH implementation approach with a hybrid type 2 study, including a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial. Including formative, process, and summative evaluation elements guided by the Exploration-Preparation-Implementation-Sustainment model, the study will evaluate impact of practice transformation and identify process elements affecting implementation effectiveness.

Despite the knowledge that these brain regions are particularly vulnerable, the diversity of neural computations within and across these brain regions is only beginning to be revealed. For example, a key function of the hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (medial entorhinal cortex) is to bridge events that are discontinuous in time, and entorhinal and hippocampal cells that are sequentially active ('time cells') have been proposed to be pivotal for memory retention over delay intervals of many seconds. In our previous work, we therefore investigated the firing patterns over the delay interval in a spatial working memory (working memory) task. We unexpectedly found that hippocampal time cells were not a general mechanism for working memory retention in hippocampus-dependent tasks. Rather, preliminary data indicate that information about past and future choices during the delay interval is evident during brief population bursts in hippocampus, while medial entorhinal cortex cells may show memory-related activity that persists irrespective of brain state. We therefore hypothesize that memory retention does not require time-varying activity over the delay interval but is rather evident in sporadic population bursts in hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (medial prefrontal cortex) throughout the delay period and in firing patterns of entorhinal cells that provide continuity irrespective of brain state. To record activity during the delay period with varying brain states, we will - within each animal - use two variants of a spatial working memory task, one with and one without forced running throughout the delay such that either theta or non-theta states are predominant. Aim 1 will focus on population bursts in hippocampus and determine whether they are only informative in non-theta states, as shown in our preliminary data, or a general mechanism across brain states. In addition, we will selectively interrupt hippocampal activity within the delay period to determine whether coding of future choices by population bursts and behavior are perturbed. Aim 2 will then perform recordings across deep and superficial layers and along the dorso-ventral axis of entorhinal cortex to identify how medial entorhinal cortex contributes to working memory. Finally, Aim 3 will carry out large-scale combined single-unit and LFP recordings in hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex and in medial entorhinal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex to reveal the coordination of mechanisms for working memory retention across brain regions and brain states. Taken together, we will identify whether neuronal activity during population bursts is a general mechanism for memory retention over delay intervals irrespective of brain state, whether medial entorhinal cortex supports working memory retention with persistent activity, and how subregions of medial prefrontal cortex are coordinated with hippocampal and entorhinal subareas along the dorso-ventral axis. Identifying these memory computations will be the foundation for treatment approaches to restore memory functions when brain circuits deteriorate in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.",5,5R01NS086947-10,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

While the individual-level correlates of viral suppression (viral suppression) are well-known, few epidemiologic studies, especially those that are digitally-based, have examined viral suppression from a multilevel lens that accounts for the role of geographic and community-level characteristics germane to the Deep South, such as aggregate poverty measures, racial segregation, and healthcare access. Epidemiological studies also typically exclude people with HIV (people with HIV) with non-sustained viral suppression (non-viral suppression) or without recent HIV labs, as these are among the hardest to identify and reach due to their limited healthcare involvement. Our highly experienced study team will address these research gaps through the proposed UG3-UH3 study, which will use mHealth technology to optimally recruit, screen, enroll, and retain a prospective digital cohort of 1000 people with HIV in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi with non-viral suppression or who otherwise lack evidence of having been in care for the previous 12 months, leveraging long-standing relationships with public health departments in each of these three states. We will assemble a community advisory board (community advisory board), consisting of people with HIV, health department partners, and HIV care team members in the three states and we will use the Information System Research (Information System Research) Framework to tailor features of an existing adherence management app for people with HIV, WiseApp. We will test usability of the Drive to Zero app prototype with people with HIV and informaticians.

Women who report intimate partner violence (intimate partner violence) have worse shortand long-term health outcomes, including increased risk for sexually transmitted infections and HIV, poor maternal health outcomes, and increased risk for suicide attempts. Perpetrator Alcohol Use Disorder (Alcohol Use Disorder) increases risk taking behaviors, and impairs problem-solving and cognitive processes, which may drive intimate partner violence. The current scientific understanding of these urgent issues has following limitations: a) most interventions improve either intimate partner violence or Alcohol Use Disorder but not both outcomes; b) interventions that successfully improve both are delivered by highly trained mental health professionals, limiting access and scalability; and c) most interventions focus on either just the husband or the wife but not both. These limitations have led to a strong scientific and implementation gap of interventions that are feasible, effective, and scalable in low-resource settings to target both intimate partner violence and Alcohol Use Disorder. Our Indo-US collaborative team pilot tested an intervention to deliver behavioral couple's therapy (behavioral couple's therapy), based on principles derived from Social Cognitive Theory (Social Cognitive Theory) to enhance couple's communication, combined with contingency management to reduce alcohol use. This intervention was acceptable, feasible and showed preliminary efficacy of intimate partner violence and alcohol use in couples when the husband had Alcohol Use Disorder. We now propose to build on and extend this intervention to combine behavioral couple's therapy with motivational interviewing (motivational interviewing), delivered by primary care nurses, to reduce alcohol use and intimate partner violence among couples in India and to test this in a randomized controlled trial. Our research team has a long history of collaborative research in South Asia. Dr. Ekstrand has a 25 year history of research in India, supported by 11 NIH-funded studies where she was the PI or MPI, six of which were at the proposed site. Drs. Acharya and Ekstrand currently oversee two NIH-funded R34 and R21 studies in South Asia successfully using motivational interviewing. Dr. Srinivasan has led several studies that examined the relationship between Alcohol Use Disorder and high-risk behavior, including intimate partner violence, and was the senior PI of our pilot intervention on which this proposal is based. Dr Srinivasan has also been MPI on three NIH-funded R01 studies with Dr. Ekstrand. We propose to build on this evidence base and robust research infrastructure at primary health clinics at our South India site. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (n= 400 couples) and study the impact of behavioral couple's therapy and motivational interviewing in reducing intimate partner violence and Alcohol Use Disorder. The intervention will be delivered by nurses in primary health centers who will be supervised by a clinical psychologist. We will perform intention to treat analyses to compare treatment and control groups on the two primary outcomes at 12-months follow-up: 1) mean scores on the Indian Family Violence and Control Scale and 2) number of days with a negative breathalyzer test over a 1-week period. We will assess secondary outcomes and other measures to conduct mixed-methods analyses to assess the theorized mechanisms of change influencing intervention effectiveness.

The microtubule cytoskeleton contributes to the internal stiffness of heart muscle cells, and under certain conditions can impede the ability of cardiomyocytes to both contract and relax. Over the first five years of this R01, we found that cardiomyocyte stiffness is tightly regulated by post-translational detyrosination of microtubules, and that detyrosinated microtubules are consistently elevated in human heart failure, concomitant with increased myocardial stiffness. We also found that reducing detyrosinated microtubules is sufficient to lower stiffness and improve contraction and relaxation in cardiomyocytes and myocardial tissue from patients with diverse forms of heart failure. We further identified the enzyme responsible for detyrosination in the heart, and showed that targeting this enzyme is sufficient to robustly improve relaxation in failing human heart cells. As such, detyrosination forms a promising new therapeutic target for the treatment of heart failure. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that genetic or small molecule targeting of the ""tyrosination cycle"" can stably improve both systolic and diastolic function in different small and large animal models of heart failure. Studies under three aims will address several components of this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will explore whether a gene therapy approach overexpressing the tyrosinating enzyme (TTL) is sufficient to improve systolic function in a genetic mouse model of heart failure, and to improve diastolic function in surgical model of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Aim 2 experiments will focus on a different therapeutic modality consisting of novel and highly potent small molecule inhibitors of the detyrosinating enzyme (VASH). We will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of these novel inhibitors and test their tolerability and efficacy for reducing detyrosination and improving cardiac function in both rodent and human cells and tissues. In Aim 3, we will move our exploration to larger animal studies and test whether targeting detyrosination is sufficient to improve myocyte and myocardial function in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Our cross-species, multi-scale and multi-pronged approach will balance our goals of reductionist rigor and integrative relevance that ultimately furthers clinical translation. Together, this work will determine if targeting detyrosinated microtubules can stably improve cardiac function in heart failure, and identify therapeutic compounds that may be suitable for progression into a clinical pipeline.",5,5R01HL133080-09,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,7,0,0

Mechanotransmission and mechanosignaling in cardiomyocytes (cardiomyocytes) rely on these protein networks, particularly in the costamere, which provides a direct mechanical link between the extracellular matrix (extracellular matrix) and the Z-disk of the sarcomere. The costamere may therefore regulate both 'inside-out' mechanotransmission (transmitting sarcomere-born forces out to the extracellular matrix) and 'outside-in' mechanosignaling (transmitting/transducing extracellular mechanical signals into the CM)-the dysfunction of either of which may be central to dilated cardiomyopathy progression. My overall hypothesis is that the costamere and cortical cytoskeleton of cardiomyocytes provide key mechanosensitive protein networks that regulate mechanical signalling pathways initiated by intracellular and extracellular forces, and that specific defects in these structures inhibits their ability to transmit and transduce mechanical forces, causing contractile dysfunction and pathological cell remodelling. Supporting this, the costamere protein Filamin C (Filamin C) has recently been implicated in a variety of human cardiomyopathies, including dilated cardiomyopathy. During my F32 postdoctoral training, I used a new mouse model that exploits cardiac-specific and inducible homozygous Filamin C deletion to trigger rapid dilated cardiomyopathy development. I found that a loss of Filamin C causes significant reductions in the tissueand celllevel contractility, as well as significant CM remodeling accompanied by a reduction in cortical cytoskeleton stiffness. However, whether Filamin C mutations in humans with dilated cardiomyopathy cause similar defects in cortex structure and mechanics, systolic mechanotransmission, and mechanosensitive gene regulation requires further investigation. Thus, the goal of my proposed research is to integrate quantitative subcellular-level structural and biomechanical measurements with quantitative measurements of intracellular stress distributions and hypertrophic gene expression patterns in response to intraand extra-cellular mechanical perturbations using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-cardiomyocytes) expressing a patientspecific Filamin C-truncating mutation. To accomplish this, I will:  combine X-ray diffraction imaging, atomic force microscopy, and multiscale computational modeling to test the hypothesis that a loss of Filamin C disrupts 'inside-out' mechanotransmission of sarcomeric forces by dysregulating myofilament lattice geometry via altered cortical cytoskeleton mechanics in murine cardiomyocytes,  apply these biophysical methods and hypotheses to a new human dilated cardiomyopathy model made from gene-edited hiPSC-cardiomyocytes expressing a patient-specific Filamin C-truncating variant, and  combine FRET-based molecular tension sensor imaging, in-vitro extracellular mechanical loading techniques, and quantitative transcriptomics to test the hypothesis that truncated Filamin C dysregulates 'outsidein' mechanosignaling in hiPSC-cardiomyocytes and promotes dilated cardiomyopathy remodeling.",5,5R00HL159224-04,PA-20-188,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,7,0,0

It also represents a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus, physical dysfunction, heart disease, and dementia. Other than exercise and diet, limited mechanism-based strategies exist to improve insulin resistance. Another shared feature of obesity and aging is accumulation of p21Cip1-highly-expressing (p21Cip1-highly-expressing) cells in various tissues. However, the roles of p21Cip1-highly-expressing cells in insulin resistance and physical dysfunction remain largely unknown. To examine the relationship between p21Cip1-highly-expressing cells and insulin resistance, we have generated and validated a novel ""p21-Cre"" transgenic mouse model containing a p21 promoter driving a Cre fused to a tamoxifen-inducible estrogen receptor (estrogen receptor) element. This novel model enables us to monitor, kill or modulate p21Cip1-highly-expressing cells in vivo without affecting other cells. In our preliminary studies, we find that intermittent clearance of p21Cip1-highly-expressing cells in obese mice significantly alleviates insulin resistance, indicating that strategies targeting these cells could result in novel approaches for managing insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. Based on these findings, we will test our central hypothesis that targeting p21Cip1-highly-expressing cells will alleviate metabolic and physical dysfunction associated with obesity. We will use p21-Cre mouse models to examine the role (Aim 1) and underlying mechanism (Aim 2) of p21Cip1-highly-expressing cells in insulin resistance and physical dysfunction. We will also leverage powerful single cell transcriptomics (single cell transcriptomics) technology to reveal the heterogeneity and conserved transcriptomic features of these p21Cip1-highly-expressing cells in tissues with obesity. This project will have a broad impact on both aging and obesity research by determining how p21Cip1-highly-expressing cells contribute to insulin resistance. Using multiple in vivo models, coupled with the powerful approach of single cell transcriptomics, we expect to gain a comprehensive understanding of p21Cip1-highly-expressing cells (at both functional and expression levels) in vivo. Results from this work will also enable future testing of pharmacological interventions that eliminate these cells to treat not only metabolic dysfunction, but also a wide range of age-related diseases.",5,5R01AG066679-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,12,2,0,0

Treatment typically involves the removal of decayed tooth structure and placement of a new restoration. Since the microbial environment remains the same, the new tooth-restoration complex may also be susceptible to failure. Thus, the problem is not adequately addressed in current dental treatment approaches. More innovative materials are required that can purposefully bias the microbial environment toward improved health. Our preliminary data demonstrate that Mg2+ or Zn2+ released from bioactive glass (BAG)-containing resin composites can support a healthy microbial environment, thus directly addressing the root of the caries problem. Here we propose a new strategy involving Mg2+-and Zn2+-releasing dental composites that can favorably alter the microbiome on and around dental restorations such that the local pH >5.5. AIM 1: Optimize Mg2+- and Zn2+-releasing bioactive glass (BAG)-containing dental composites for long-term support of a healthy oral microbiome. Scanning electrochemical microscopy (Scanning electrochemical microscopy) will be used to optimize pH dependent Mg2+ and Zn2+ release kinetics from different Mgand Zn-BAG formulations. Later, dental plaque derived multi species biofilm growth rate, volume, species composition and pH at the BAG surface will be quantified and optimized such that local pH > 5.5. AIM 2: Test the effectiveness of new Mg-BAG and Zn-BAG composites in an in vitro secondary caries model. Placement of a restoration has the inherent challenge of gap formation between the dental material and the tooth structure. Currently, little information is available on how bacteria behave in microgaps. For example, microbial colonization, diffusion rates, and organic acid metabolites may be very different within gaps as compared to exposed surfaces in the oral cavity, potentially leading to enhanced tooth decay at the interface. Here we will develop an in vitro microgap model using the electrochemical sensors techniques to measure the biological activity and the effect on the microbial population in these microenvironments such that local pH > 5.5. AIM 3: In situ evaluation of Mg-BAG and Zn-BAG composites with intraoral appliances. The cytotoxicity of Mg-BAG and Zn-BAG will be tested using undifferentiated dental pulp cells compared to standard dental composites. The in vitro optimized Mg-BAG and Zn-BAG composites that are shown to have equal or lower cytotoxicity than typical composite will be placed in intraoral appliances to be tested in volunteers. This real-life scenario will evaluate the effectiveness of the composites when all biologically relevant parameters are present that potentially interfere with the performance of Mg-BAG and Zn-BAG composites. This will also provide a direct comparison between the in vitro model and the clinical situation. Our proposal will lay the foundation for further metal ions driven research on biofilm growth and behavior, as well as for the development of a more realistic in vitro secondary caries model that includes chemical microenvironments created by differential biofilm metabolic activities within microscopic gaps.",2,2R01DE027999-06A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH,7,9,1,3

Data have identified β cell signaling pathways activated during diabetes development that exacerbate β cell failure and death. Defining these pathways and their contribution to diabetes will ultimately pave the way for novel β cell targeted biomarkers and therapies. Extracellular vesicles (Extracellular vesicles) are membrane bound nanoparticles that can be transferred to other cells as a means of cell:cell communication. Emerging data suggest that β cell-derived exosomes, an EV subtype released by exocytosis of multivesicular bodies, and their cargo may act as paracrine effectors in islet health. However, the mechanisms linking β cell stress to changes in exosome cargo and whether activation of these pathways can impact diabetes progression remain unexplored. The central hypothesis of this application is that DNA damage induced by islet inflammatory stress activates signaling pathways regulating β cell exosome miRNA cargo, initiating a cascade of β cell death and dysfunction through exosomal miRNA transfer to surrounding β cells. Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanistic etiology of cytokine-induced alterations in β cell exosome microRNA cargo. We hypothesize that cytokine-induced β cell DNA damage and p53 activation engage ceramide-dependent exosomal formation pathways. This process ultimately increases ceramide-enriched exosome subpopulations, and drives critical differences in exosome miRNA cargo. To test this, experiments will utilize chemical and genetic manipulation of β cell DNA damage, p53 activation, and ceramide generation. Aim 2 will utilize in vitro and in vivo models to determine the functional relevance of β cell exosome microRNA cargo transfer to other β cells. We hypothesize that cytokine-induced alterations in β cell exosome miRNA cargo exacerbate β cell death, dedifferentiation, and dysfunction by exosomal transfer of miRNAs to surrounding β cells. Aim 3 will utilize a bead based pulldown to enrich human circulating EV pools for islet cell-derived Extracellular vesicles. We hypothesize that proteins specific to β cells will also be present in β cell Extracellular vesicles, therefore enabling selective isolation of β cell-derived Extracellular vesicles. We will test whether human subjects with or at-risk for diabetes exhibit altered circulating islet cell-derived EV miRNAs. Functional experiments will define differential effects of incubation of circulating islet-derived Extracellular vesicles on recipient human β cells. This work will lead to a paradigm shift in the research community's understanding of β cell:β cell communication, and determine the clinical biomarker potential of islet-derived EV cargo in diabetes.",5,5R01DK121929-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,12,2,0,0

Most cases retain some MHC expression, and strategies for upregulation may enhance immunogenicity. Melanocyte development is regulated by the master transcription factor MITF which targets virtually all components of the pigmentation machinery. This pathway is vulnerable to protein aggregation (e.g., after UV/tanning). MITF appears to simultaneously target certain ""quality control"" factors that protect against misfolded species. We recently discovered MITF's direct transcriptional regulation of a protease gene called DDI2 which we found to participate in ER ""quality control."" Unexpectedly, among the proteins degraded downstream of DDI2, are MHC-I and MHC-II, leading to decreased antigen presentation. We believe this occurs because peptide-MHC complexes may be ""mis-perceived"" as unfolded due to thermodynamic features of peptide-MHC interactions. Importantly, we found that DDI2 suppression by gene knockout or drug, upregulates MHC-antigen levels, producing functional stimulation of antigen-specific T cell activation, and enhanced tumor killing both in vitro and in vivo (with anti-PD1) in multiple tumor types. The active sites of DDI2 and HIV-1 protease coincidentally bear striking homology, and two FDA approved HIV protease inhibitors also block DDI2 (multiple others do not). One of these, Nelfinavir (Nelfinavir) is a well-tolerated drug, and potently phenocopies DDI2 knockout. The combination of highly defined human and mouse melanoma models, which include antigen-specific MHCrestricted matched CD8 and CD4 T cells, coupled to deep cellular, molecular, proteomic, immunophenotyping, and tumor treatment assays, permit us to propose the following studies: Specific Aim 1 expands our evidence that DDI2 suppression (knockout or drug) enhances anti-PD1 activity, by testing in complementary mouse models, combinations of DDI2-KO or Nelfinavir with anti-CTLA4, anti-LAG3, and 3-way combinations together with anti-PD1, as these are FDA approved treatments. All will be scrutinized with detailed immunophenotyping, MHC/peptidomics, and other expression assays. Specific Aim 2 examines immunopeptidomics: isolation and sequencing of MHC-associated peptide antigens. This tests which antigenic peptides are increased by DDI2 suppression, as we hypothesize that DDI2 suppression rescues a more diverse peptide population, and may boost T cell diversity (also to be tested by TCRseq). Specific Aim 3 probes MITF's demonstrated direct regulation of DDI2, predicting a pathway that links MITF to MHC-antigen levels and, thereby, to immune evasion, which would be a novel and druggable oncogenic mechanism. Specific Aim 4 dissects data from >200 single cell RNAseq of anti-PD1-resistant patients plus additional anti-PD1 sensitive ones, where we will determine DDI2 expression (RNA and protein) and use multiplex immunofluorescence to quantify MHC-I and -II levelslinked to microenvironment immune populations and clinical annotation of responses.

A promising avenue to dissect this interplay at a mechanistic level is through the study of microbiome-derived molecules that mediate important microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions. In this application, we propose a hybrid computationalsynthetic biology approach to discover, rationally prioritize and systematically characterize microbiomederived molecules. We propose to apply this approach to three structurally diverse classes of bioactive molecules that are widely encoded by the human microbiome but remain severely understudied in terms of both structure and function. First, guided by the computational analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters in metagenomic sequencing data from the human microbiome of thousands of subjects, we will select specific members of the three molecular classes for experimental characterization. Second, we will use genome editing of native members of the microbiome and synthetic biology in a multi-host heterologous expression platform to characterize the selected pathways and their products. Finally, we will employ an array of in vitro, cell-based and mouse colonization assays to interrogate the role of the discovered molecules in mediating relevant host and microbiome functions.

There is now strong evidence from large consortia studies that mutations in genes involved in chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, and synaptic proteins confer substantial risk for autism spectrum disorder; however, the extent to which these genes are interconnected and ultimately converge on a small number of functional deficits is largely unknown. A critical need therefore exists to model new gene discoveries, to directly evaluate their functional impact, and to determine their points of convergence. Innovations from our team and others in high-throughput CRISPR-engineering have now made parallelized mechanistic studies tractable, and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSCs) derived neurons are well-suited to test the impact of autism spectrum disorder risk variants predicted to exert their influence during fetal cortical development. Here, our multi-PI proposal will undertake an ambitious, systematic isogenic loss-of-function (loss-of-function) mechanistic screen in a compendium of 48 of the most robust autism spectrum disorder risk genes discovered from the largest genetic studies to date. Moreover, our exciting preliminary results suggest that transcriptional signatures shared across neuronal models of autism spectrum disorder genes converge on critical regulatory nodes that result in synaptic deficits. Aim 1 will characterize isogenic glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons with highly penetrant loss-of-function mutations in 48 genes associated with autism spectrum disorder risk at genome-wide significant thresholds and that are expressed in neurons. These analyses will identify transcriptional and functional signatures of individual autism spectrum disorder genes through RNAseq and a series of high-throughput phenotyping assays in both neuronal sub-types. Aim 2 will expand our Preliminary Results to discover convergent genes downstream of autism spectrum disorder risk loci, characterize the synaptic consequences of the ten most compelling discoveries from individual genes and/or convergent signatures, and integrate these data to explore the druggability of the convergent networks. Our overarching goal is to define any commonalities among diverse genes, pathways and networks that underlie autism spectrum disorder etiology, and to dramatically expand the list of possible therapeutic targets for autism spectrum disorder.

The overall objective of this proposal is to build upon our exciting preliminary observations describing the identification of endogenous microproteins and peptides detected in cell-free supernatants of community-associated (community-associated) MRSA cultures. Within this group we identified two novel microproteins originating from an unannotated locus in the community-associated-MRSA TCH1516 genome. We found that these microproteins, termed S. aureus microprotein 1 (S. aureus microprotein 1) and S. aureus microprotein 2 (S. aureus microprotein 2), are highly conserved among Staphylococci and are regulated by the classical accessory gene regulatory system. We have started to characterize these factors, showing that S. aureus microprotein 1 appears to act as a canonical cytolysin. Intriguingly, S. aureus microprotein 2 possesses unique bioactivity, the perturbation of keratin networks that promotes an in vivo switch from a localized S. aureus skin infection to an invasive dissemination to the underlying tissues. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that SAMs significantly contribute to community-associated-MRSA's ability to cause disease in a host. In Aim 1, we will dissect the pathogenic contributions of S. aureus microprotein 1 as a functional cytolysin in vitro and in vivo. Given the bioactivity of S. aureus microprotein 1 is inhibited by serum lipoproteins, we will focus on its role once community-associated-MRSA is in an intracellular environment. Our strong preliminary data suggests S. aureus microprotein 1 selectively binds to prohibitins (prohibitins) across differential host cell types. Thus, we will take the study of community-associated-MRSA cytolysins in a new direction by dissecting the potential role of prohibitins as targets of S. aureus microprotein 1. In Aim 2, we will perform a structure and function analysis of the interaction between S. aureus microprotein 2 and keratin. Our data shows that this interaction has an important in vivo consequence during the shift from a local to invasive infection type. By a powerful combination of microbiology and multi-omic approaches, we will define the S. aureus microprotein 2 structural contact points required for pathogenesis and will detail host pathways that are impacted by S. aureus microprotein 2 during the invasive switch.

Aim 3 is critical given that the importance of SAMs in other Staphylococci beyond community-associated-MRSA TCH1516 remains unknown. This proposal is highly innovative because it departs from the current focus of investigating host-pathogen interactions through the more established genomic and proteomic workflows.

The long-term goal of my research program is to develop new electrochemical and microfluidic tools to study dynamic neuroimmune communication to understand the molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation. To achieve this goal, new approaches are needed which can measure immune cell communication with higher temporal resolution. The specific objective of this proposal is to demonstrate and determine the mechanism of subsecond dopamine signaling from CD4+ CD25+ T-cells (Tregs) and to establish how dopamine release from senescent Tregs impacts neuronal health. Tregs are important immune cells that function to suppress the immune system and have been implicated in several age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Tregs contain the machinery to synthesize and respond to dopamine; however, to date, direct real-time measurements of dopamine release and how this subsecond signaling influences neuron-immune crosstalk has not been possible. Current paradigms hold that immune cell secretion of neurotransmitters does not occur with subsecond dynamics seen in neurons and is therefore dispensable in neuronal biology. The evidence supporting this viewpoint is limited by the lack of experimental systems to measure physiological secretion of neurotransmitters by immune cells on this timescale. Our unprecedented preliminary studies using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (fast-scan cyclic voltammetry) reveals that T cells are capable of rapid subsecond secretion of dopamine. This proposal is based on the premise that employing traditional neuroscience methods to investigate neurochemical signaling in isolated immune cells can yield valuable insights into the dynamic mechanisms of subsecond immune cell communication during aging. The proposal will be completed by the following two specific aims:  Ascertain the mechanism of subsecond dopamine release from Tregs and  Develop a neuron-Treg co-culture platform to probe the consequence of subsecond Treg-derived dopamine signaling on neuronal health with age. We will pursue these aims with an innovative approach combining the power of fast-scan cyclic voltammetry's subsecond detection capabilities with traditional immunology approaches in co-cultures of Tregs and cholinergic neurons. This work is significant because we will reveal the ability of Tregs to release dopamine on a subsecond timescale and demonstrate that this rapid immunederived neurochemical signaling influences neuronal health for the first time. The expected outcome is a new understanding of the dynamics of immune cell signaling and a deeper understanding of the molecular changes which occur at the neuron-immune cell synapse as a function of age. This work will have a positive impact on how we study immune cell signaling, and will advance current knowledge of how neurochemicals help regulate immunity leading to advancements in targeted immunotherapies for neurodegenerative diseases.",1,1R21AG086735-01,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,0,13,5,1

Heat shock has long been conceived of as a proteotoxic stress, triggering formation of toxic aggregates of denatured proteins, which must be cleaned up by induced heat shock proteins. Recent results from our group and others have established a complementary paradigm: temperature acts as a physiological signal, triggering the adaptive formation of biomolecular condensates with specific cellular functions, and the condensation process is regulated by heat shock proteins. Crucially, in the proteotoxic model, aggregates are trash, but in the adaptive condensation model, they are functional treasure. Using an integrated set of biochemical, cell biological, and evolutionary approaches established over the past decade, we are pursuing three linked areas: 1) identifying and dissecting the cellular functions of particular heat-shock and stress-induced condensates of protein and mRNA; 2) studying the regulation of condensation and dispersal, focusing on the specificity of physiological condensates and their remodeling and reversal by stress-induced molecular chaperones; and 3) probing the sensation and transduction of temperature into adaptive responses in fungi which rely on warm-blooded hosts for growth or dispersal, and in the temperature-dependent activation of cells in the vertebrate immune system during fever.

To better understand this relationship, we examine how passive social media use (pSMU)-monitoring other people's lives without engaging in direct exchanges with others-leads to poor mental health (Aim 1), when people engage in pSMU and how this coping strategy impacts mental health (Aim 2), and for whom pSMU is likely to undermine mental health (Aims 3) in a longitudinal study (n=400) in adolescents (ages 13-17; 50% Male/Female; 50% Black/White youth). There will be a 2-month focused study period. The initial and final 2 weeks of the 2-month study period will use ecological momentary assessment-based surveys (5 prompts a day) to measure pSMU, and to characterize affective responses to both pSMU and stress exposures the youth encounter in daily life. Objective pSMU will also be measured using an app installed on the youth's phone in order to continuously measure pSMU over the entire 2-month intensive study period. We will measure stress exposures and responses in two novel ways. First, using GPS tracking we will determine the youth's exposures to objectively stressful environments (i.e., high crime areas). Second, we will use GPS to trigger EMA prompts at locations youth reported as being stressful at baseline. The influences of these experiences on mental health trajectories (measured at weeks 0,2,4,6,8 and 20 will be assessed. Additionally, we focus on the relationship of pSMU to two physiological pathways that are responsive to social stress and influence risk for poor mental health: a) the parasympathetic nervous system, the function of which will be continuously measured using a self-charging wristband worn by the youth for the entire 2-month intensive study period to quantify shifts in heart-rate variability (heart-rate variability); b) and the expression of immune and other socially stress responsive gene pathways in blood cells sampled on week 0,2,6, and 8. This will provide the opportunity to determine the effects of pSMU on momentary affect, momentary heart-rate variability, immune related gene expression, a marker of general inflammation (CRP), and changes in depressive symptoms (Aim 1). We will also determine the role of stressor exposure (self-reported and GPS based) upon pSMU (Aim 2a) and the degree to which pSMU as a stress coping strategy moderates the effects of stressor exposure on affective response, heart-rate variability, stress related gene signaling pathways, inflammation, and mental health measures (Aim 2b).

As an alternative, bulk segregant analysis under drug pressure can be used to pinpoint loci of interest. P. falciparum genetic crosses were initially carried out in splenectomized chimpanzees, but NIH has banned chimpanzee research for financial and ethical reasons. To overcome this, we have developed and improved on a human-liver chimeric mouse model (the FRG NOD huHep mouse) to replace the chimpanzee for the generation of recombinant progeny from P. falciparum genetic crosses. The FRG NOD mouse lacks the fumaryl acetoacetate hydrolase gene (F designation) and this causes hepatocyte cell death. However, hepatocyte death is controlled with the drug nitisinone. Since only mouse hepatocytes lack fumaryl acetoacetate hydrolase, this enables repopulation of the mouse with human hepatocytes over time with on-off drug use to control the death of mouse hepatocytes and their replacement with human hepatocytes. In close collaboration with the Yecuris Corporation, who creates the FRG NOD huHep mouse, we ensure that the mice we use for our studies have maximal human hepatocyte chimerism and are susceptible to P. falciparum sporozoite infection. Additionally, the mice are able to maintain a human red blood cell (human red blood cell) population after human red blood cell infusion and this allows for P. falciparum liver stage-to-blood stage transition in the mouse. Following blood removal, the in vitro expansion of asexual P. falciparum blood stages allows for bulk segregant analysis as well as downstream cloning and then -omics analyses and phenotypic analyses of recombinant progeny. We have clearly demonstrated our ability to use the FRG NOD huHep/human red blood cell mouse for the generation of recombinant progeny from experimental crosses and Core A will continue to produce recombinant progeny from a further ten well-conceived experimental genetic crosses between P. falciparum drug resistant and drug susceptible strains as part of this P01 renewal. The phenotyping of bulk and isolated progeny supplied by Core A and downstream mapping of genetic loci responsible for observed phenotypes are integral parts of RP01, RP02 & RP03 and, as such, Core A is the linchpin of this P01 renewal. Successful creation of progeny for this P01 will further our understanding of the spread of artemisinin drug resistance, which has now been documented to have occurred independently in Africa and is of grave concern to malaria control and elimination efforts.",2,2P01AI127338-06A1,PAR-22-225,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

The blood of inflammatory Bowel Disease patients exists in a hypercoagulable state and thromboembolism (thromboembolism), in which life-threatening blood clots break off and travel through the blood stream to block other vessels, is the most significant cause of mortality in inflammatory Bowel Disease. This increased risk is between 3and 15fold during inactive and active disease respectively. Necropsy studies report thrombosis affects up to 40% of inflammatory Bowel Disease patients, and 25% of patients suffering a thrombotic event have a fatal outcome. Current treatment regimens do not address thrombosis risk, and widespread steroid use increases risk. In addition to their classical role in hemostasis, platelets have emerged as novel regulators of the immune response that act as significant drivers of inflammation and tissue damage. Clinical reports suggest that platelet abnormalities associate with inflammatory Bowel Disease activity, severity, and thrombosis risk, however molecular pathways responsible for increased platelet reactivity and thrombosis in inflammatory Bowel Disease are not well studied. This proposal tests the significant and innovative hypothesis that platelets become transcriptionally altered toward hyperactivation in inflammatory Bowel Disease and identified the C-type lectin layilin as a novel regulator of platelet activation and thrombosis. We will employ complementary clinical, in vitro, and in vivo approaches, a unique resource of patient tissues and expertise with human platelets and microvascular endothelial cells, along with state-of-the-art sequencing techniques, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and intravital microscopy to rigorously test this hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 will determine how regulators of platelet activation, including layilin, are altered during active and inactive disease in inflammatory Bowel Disease and contribute to disease outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will determine how layilin regulates platelet activation, define downstream activation pathways, and identify receptors and ligands mediating platelet adhesion to novel, inflammatory hyaluronan-cable matrices. Specific Aim 3 will establish how targeting pathways downstream of layilin in platelets improves inflammation and thrombosis during colitis. Successful completion of these aims will 1) determine how transcriptional changes in platelets contribute to inflammation and thrombosis in inflammatory Bowel Disease, 2) determine downstream regulators of platelet activation mediated by layilin, 3) establish whether targeting dysregulated platelet activation pathways in improves inflammation and thrombosis in murine colitis.

However, among all anatomical tissue locations in the human body, the central nervous system (central nervous system) arguably represents the most difficult one to access and to evaluate for viral infection and persistence. Recently, we and others have made significant progress in defining viral reservoirs at a single-cell and single-molecule resolution, using a platform of novel next-generation sequencing assays allowing to simultaneously analyzing near full-length proviral sequences, the corresponding chromosomal integration sites and the respective HIV-1 RNA expression profile from individual viral reservoir cells. Using such technologies, we observed evidence for immune-mediated selection mechanisms that enable long-term persistence of viral reservoir cells with features of deep latency, while reservoir cells with higher susceptibility to reactivation signals seemed to be actively selected against; in rare cases of individuals with ""elite control"", such selection mechanism resulted in a highly-restricted viral reservoir configuration consisting of intact proviruses located in heterochromatin positions not permissive to viral transcription. Here we will propose to use this established and fully-operational technology pipeline for a detailed analysis of the frequency, clonality and replication competence of proviruses isolated from sorted central nervous system cells, in particular from myeloid parenchymal microglia, from myeloid perivascular macrophages and astrocytes (Specific Aim 1). In addition, we will utilize novel next-generation sequencing assays for characterizing the chromosomal locations of intact and defective proviruses, and their associated epigenetic chromatin microenvironment, using ATAC-Seq, ChIP-Seq and Methylation-Seq assays (Specific Aim 2). For a functional evaluation of proviruses residing in the central nervous system, we will subsequently conduct reactivation assays with single patient-derived virally-infected cells from the central nervous system, allowing us to determine how chromosomal positioning and epigenetic features affect the transcriptional activity of proviruses and their susceptibility to latency-reversing agents (Specific Aim 3). Together, these investigations will provide high-resolution insight into the dynamics of HIV-1 persistence in myeloid central nervous system cell subsets and may be highly informative for targeted HIV-1 cure interventions.",5,5R01MH134823-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,9,11,1,3

To achieve this core goal, this optimization proposal will address the most pressing areas of technology development to enable the dissemination of polymer microelectrode arrays with such capability and promote their integration into neuroscience research practice. Polymer-based neural interfaces can achieve high-quality recordings over a year or more which is attributed to the greater stability of the device-tissue interface compared to more rigid metallic wire and silicon-based neural interfaces. Another distinct advantage is that the same microfabrication technology can be used to produce batches of surface and penetrating electrode arrays with carefully controlled features with micron and submicron dimensional precision. Microfabricated polymer probes are already available in limited designs having shank lengths of 10 mm or less and therefore predominantly used in rats. This technology needs to be extended for access to deeper brain regions in rodents and a wide range of brain targets in larger animals, including nonhuman primates, an important model in neuroscience and preclinical research. Existing device designs such as the prototype arrays previously developed for the rat hippocampus cannot simply be scale up or down to expand access to brain regions across different species. Instead, careful design is required in collaboration with users to meet space and weight requirements as well as workflow requirements to achieve precise placement at the desired depth. Therefore, this proposal tackles the necessary optimization of the previously developed technology to enable a library of designs that will enable their use in different animal models and to target different brain regions. Another goal is to develop the appropriate insertion methods for reliably placing electrodes at the desired depth and targeted region. Once the passive recording arrays and the matching surgical insertion methods are developed and optimized at the benchtop, these will be evaluated in mice, rats, and NHPs. Overall, this proposal not only addresses optimization but further advances in polymer microelectrode array technology for neural interfaces. This will enable early dissemination of polymer array systems for large-scale monitoring and manipulation of neural activity in collaboration with early adopters and demonstration of high-quality recordings obtained in multiple species over long periods that will attract additional users.

Answers may lie less in individual diagnostic categories, but instead in global, transdiagnostic patterns of symptoms, notably their prominent and clinically useful division into internalizing (e.g., anxiety) vs. externalizing (e.g., aggression) forms. This project aims to characterize these two symptom clusters and their development (per NIMH strategic plan goal #2), by relating them to computational mechanisms for decision making that have been studied in the healthy brain. Previous computational psychiatry research grounds some internalizing symptoms such as worry in dysregulated mental simulation, or ""internal information seeking."" Here, we propose and test a hypothesis to extend this framework to comprise externalizing symptoms, which we suggest are grounded in parallel dysregulation of external information seeking (exploration of the environment), building on a recent theory. Because these computational capacities, as well as many mental health symptoms, emerge in childhood and adolescence, there is a unique opportunity to understand their relationship via development. We will use computational modelling to derive signatures of both sorts of information seeking from participants' choice behavior in two reinforcement learning tasks. We hypothesize that internalizing vs. externalizing symptoms are associated, respectively, with enhanced internal vs. external information seeking, and further reflect aberrant developmental trajectories. We test this in Aim 1 by comparing task behavior to psychiatric symptoms in two large general population samples collected online in adults. Next, in Aim 2, we examine how these processes develop using the same tasks in children and adolescents, and how this development differs in children with a diagnosed internalizing or externalizing disorder. The present research leverages and tests a unifying computational theory that situates both types of information seeking as parallel options in a tradeoff between acting for immediate reward vs delaying to gather information and improve later choices. This account can overcome a crucial gap in current computational psychiatry research, which only accounts for a relatively narrow range of symptoms. By connecting computational neuroscience, psychiatry, and development, this project will clarify the neurocomputational foundations of a wide range of externalizing and internalizing symptoms.",5,5R01MH135587-02,RFA-MH-20-110,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,5,1

Clinical laboratory data must be annotated with standard reference concepts to seamlessly play its part in data-science analytics. For over 25 years, the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC®) terminology standard from the Regenstrief Institute has played the role of trusted identifiers for many clinical observations. LOINC codes are logically composed from constituent Parts to describe unique concepts with sufficient detail to discriminate specific labs and clinical findings. However, data science ultimately seeks to apply computational reasoning and inferencing across data collections and public datasets. Static annotations, while establishing unique identities for biomedical concepts, do not contribute to the goals of reasoning and inference absent asserted relationships between and among a) the concepts within a specific terminology such as LOINC, and ideally b) concepts in related terminologies and ontologies. The core purpose of this proposal is to engineer LOINC content so that datasets that are annotated with LOINC elements (codes and concepts) will facilitate data science analytics. This will be achieved through Ontology Web Language rendering, linkage to well-formed external ontologies, demonstrating applications that leverage the logical associations, and engaging the LOINC and data science communities to prioritize and validate these efforts. We will restructure LOINC components, terms, and codes into an Ontology Web Language (Ontology Web Language) rendering to support reasoning. This will include the formalization of LOINC groups and potential related aggregations under ""uber codes"" (e.g. all blood glucoses). We will link LOINC Components Parts to external, unencumbered ontologies such as Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest). These linkages can inform the hierarchy and relationships asserted in the Ontology Web Language structure. We will demonstrate the application of Ontology Web Language and related hierarchical reasoning services to allow lumping, splitting and linking of clinical data that is directly or indirectly anchored in LOINC. Using FHIR examples, provide examples and code libraries that allow observations to be queried and aggregated (e.g. all blood glucoses).

Fear generalization can lead to maladaptive responses in a safe environment. Our laboratory uses a behavioral assay called contextual fear discrimination (contextual fear discrimination) to assess fear generalization in mice. We shock a mouse in one context (context A), and then we can measure whether they can discriminate between this aversive, shock-paired context and a similar, but safe context (context B) over approximately 10 days of discrimination learning. In our recent publications, we show that 1) adolescent male, but not adolescent female mice overgeneralize fear; 2) adult female, but not adult male mice overgeneralize fear; and 3) aged mice of both sexes overgeneralize fear and cannot discriminate between two contexts. Therefore, there is clearly an ageand sex-dependent influence on fear overgeneralization. However, the neural ensembles mediating fear generalization across the lifespan have yet to be identified. In this grant proposal, we will use this contextual fear discrimination paradigm, in combination with an activity-dependent tagging genetic mouse line to identify and pharmacologically manipulate the neural ensembles mediating fear generalization. In Aim 1, we will identify and quantify the neural ensembles mediating fear generalization in adolescent and adult mice by utilizing the ArcCreERT2 x EYFP mice. This mouse line allows for the indelible labeling of cells expressing the immediate early gene (immediate early gene) Arc/Arg3.1 and allows for a comparison between the cells that are activated during the encoding of a memory and those that are activated during the retrieval of the corresponding memory, with the overlap between the two populations being defined as an engram or memory trace. Therefore, using our activity-dependent tagging mouse line, we can determine where and how sex and age impact fear generalization neural ensembles throughout the brain. In Aim 2, we will pharmacologically manipulate adolescent and adult mice with the goal of improving behavioral fear overgeneralization and the corresponding neural circuits. In the last two decades, (R,S)- ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant. Interestingly, we have reported that (R,S)-ketamine decreases fear generalization. Here, male and female adolescent and adult mice will be administered a single dose of saline or (R,S)-ketamine. contextual fear discrimination and ex vivo whole-brain imaging will be used in order to identify the underlying neural ensembles. The outcome of this study will provide direct evidence that altered neural ensembles result in fear overgeneralization, and that (R,S)-ketamine has the potential to decrease fear overgeneralization, a core system of anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder.",5,5R21MH133107-02,PA-21-235,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,5,1

Yet only half of adults with diabetes achieve recommended blood pressure targets. These disparities are more pronounced in immigrant and minoritized groups that experience a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease. South Asians (persons with ancestry from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan or other parts of the South Asian continent) represent one of the fastest -growing immigrant populations in the US and many of them experience high rates of poverty, limited English proficiency (limited English proficiency) and barriers to accessing healthcare that may contributeto their disproportionateburdenof DMII and hypertension. Our work in NYC and Atlanta has demonstrated the efficacy and feasibility of linguistically and culturally tailored community health worker (CHW)-led telehealth programs to improve diabetes and co-morbid hypertension management among South Asians with DMII. Our model offers opportunities to specifically inform diffusion of a telehealth intervention to the South Asian immigrant community, which has experienced growth in both large urban areas that may contain a wealth of culturally tailored resources, as well as in mid-sized/small cities and suburban areas where ethnic-specific resources may be sparse, creating the ideal context to evaluate the delivery of telehealth education centralized in urban hubs. The proposedproject will build on a well-established collaboration between researchers at the NYU School of Medicine, Emory School of Medicine, community-based primary care practices, and community partners across the northeastern and southeastern US to promote comorbid DMII and hypertension management among South Asians. The overall goal of our type 1 hybrid trial is to test the effectiveness and implementation process of a culturally and contextually tailored telehealth -based CHW-led coaching intervention for hypertension control among 450 South Asian patients with co-morbid DMII and hypertension. The Specific Aims are to: 1. Using a randomized controlled trial design, test the effectiveness of a CHW-led telehealth intervention compared to usual care among individuals with DMII and uncontrolled hypertension. The primary outcome is blood pressure control, defined as <130/80 mmHg. We hypothesize that 20% more patients in the intervention arm (relative to control) will achieve blood pressure control at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will include reduction in HbA1c and weight at 6 and 12 months, BP control at 12 months, enhanced use of community services, and increased self-efficacy; and 2. Using RE-AIM and CFIR frameworks, examine the reach, adoption, fidelity, and maintenance of the intervention within clinical and community settings, and delineate contextual factors influencing implementation outcomes. This study addresses the urgent need to test telehealth and CHW-led interventions to address cardiovascular disease disparities in immigrant communities living outside of urban hubs.

However, approximately one in two individuals with bipolar disorder are non -adherent with medication, often leading to severe and negative consequences. Unfortunately, there is no widely used evidence-based approach to target poor adherence in bipolar disorder. Customized Adherence Enhancement (Customized Adherence Enhancement), developed by this study team, is a brief, practical bipolar disorder -specific approach that identifies individual adherence barriers and then targets these areas for intervention using a flexibly-administered modular format. A prospective, 6-month, randomized controlled efficacy trial (randomized controlled efficacy trial) of Customized Adherence Enhancement vs. a rigorous control, bipolar disorder-specific education (education) found that medication adherence and functional status were improved in Customized Adherence Enhancement vs. education for poorly-adherent patients. Remarkably, the benefits of Customized Adherence Enhancement occurred in individuals who had been living with bipolar disorder, on average, for over 2 decades. While promising, the original efficacy randomized controlled efficacy trial was limited by the fact that it was performed in an academic medical center, did not make use of existing web/text messaging technology, and did not address potential challenges to scale -up in standard clinical settings. In response to PA-18-722 ""Improving Patient Adherence to Treatment and Prevention Regimens to Promote Health"", this Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation project will adapt Customized Adherence Enhancement for use in community/publicsector care settings, test effectiveness in high-risk, poorly adherent individuals in these settings, and gather evidence on barriers and facilitators to implementation of the intervention in order to inform subsequent scaleup. The project will examine putative mechanistic engagement targets suggested by previous work and include implementation elements that will inform future dissemination should findings be positive. The project will be implemented in 4 specific aims: 1) Refine the Customized Adherence Enhancement intervention guided by stakeholders at a community mental health clinic (community mental health clinic) and a safety-net county healthcare system, 2) Test the effectiveness of technologyfacilitated Customized Adherence Enhancement vs. enhanced treatment as usual (enhanced treatment as usual) using a prospective, 2-site randomized controlled efficacy trial, 3) Test the effects of Customized Adherence Enhancement vs. enhanced treatment as usual on functional status in poorly adherent individuals with bipolar disorder, and 4) Identify barriers and facilitators to Customized Adherence Enhancement implementation in order to inform subsequent scale-up and spread using qualitative methods and guided by implementation conceptual models. Additional exploratory analysis will assess whether changes in patientlevel adherence barriers and facilitators mediate the treatment effects on adherence. Finally, the project will evaluate outpatient visits, no-show rates (outpatient visits, no-show rates) and off-site (emergency department visits, hospitalizations) health resource use to help characterize relative value and inform future sustainability efforts. An over-arching goal of this project will be to provide a curriculum-driven adherence enhancement approach that can be implemented in public-sector care settings and which can improve outcomes for the most vulnerable groups of people with bipolar disorder.",5,5R01MH119487-05,PA-18-722,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,1,3,3,2

Despite prophylaxis, infectious complications after craniotomy range from 1-3%, with approximately half caused by Staphylococcus aureus (Staphylococcus aureus), which forms a biofilm on the bone flap that is recalcitrant to antibiotics. We have developed a mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus craniotomy infection that shares important ultrastructural, MRI, and immune attributes with human disease, which can be exploited to identify mechanisms for infection persistence. Our preliminary results suggest that T cells maintain Staphylococcus aureus in a biofilm state to minimize the shedding of planktonic bacteria into the brain. Ultimately, this helps protect the CNS parenchyma but does not clear the biofilm. This is supported by the fact that bacterial burden was unchecked in Rag1 KO mice and in WT animals following CD4+ T cell depletion, reflecting increased planktonic bacteria in the brain and galea. Furthermore, T cell loss coincided with an attenuated activation signature in microglia, macrophages, and granulocytes, with significant reductions in several IFN-ɣ-regulated genes, including CXCL10, indicative of T cell-innate immune crosstalk. We aim to understand this regulation in addition to T cell-biofilm crosstalk to devise novel strategies to promote biofilm eradication. This possibility is feasible given our innovative bacterial scRNA-seq data, where activated CD4+ T cells induced the expression of several Staphylococcus aureus virulence genes, including protein A (spa) that binds the Fc portion of antibody to inhibit opsonophagocytosis. CXCL10 has been reported to induce Spa shedding from the bacterial membrane, which raises the intriguing possibility that CXCL10 induction by T cells promotes Spa release to block Staphylococcus aureus phagocytosis, which is supported by our preliminary data where craniotomy infection was significantly reduced with a Staphylococcus aureus spa mutant. This proposal will examine the hypothesis that CD4+ T cells regulate antimicrobial responses in the brain and galea by targeting microglia/macrophages vs. PMNs/G-MDSCs, respectively, to prevent bacterial outgrowth and limit invasion into the brain. In response, Staphylococcus aureus alters its transcriptiome to augment virulence factor expression to promote biofilm persistence. This represents a host-pathogen triad that dictates infection outcome and the molecular mechanisms responsible for bacterial persistence in the brain and galea will be examined in the following Specific Aims: 1) Identify the critical CD4+ Th subset and antigen specificity in controlling Staphylococcus aureus outgrowth during craniotomy infection; 2) Determine key mechanisms of T cell-innate immune crosstalk that dictate biofilm growth and CNS invasion; and 3) Identify Staphylococcus aureus biofilm genes that are critical for subverting T cell effector function during craniotomy infection. An improved understanding of how T cells shape the innate immune landscape and Staphylococcus aureus virulence during craniotomy infection may be leveraged to enhance antimicrobial activity and biofilm clearance to reduce patient morbidity.",5,5R01AI169788-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

We have recently shown that face emotion recognition deficits in schizophrenia (schizophrenia) and autism disorder spectrum (autism disorder spectrum) are associated with impaired activation and resting-state functional connectivity within early visual regions and between early visual cortex and pulvinar nucleus (pulvinar nucleus) of the thalamus. Furthermore, we have shown that these deficits interrelate with impaired generation of alpha-frequency oscillations, which are known to mediate pulvinar nucleus-cortical connectivity. At present, tools for modulation of oscillatory activity within deep structures are limited. In this project, we will implement a non-invasive deep brain stimulation technique termed transcranial Interference Stimulation (transcranial Interference Stimulation) to directly modulate the oscillatory activity of pulvinar nucleus and to understand and modify temporal dynamics of face emotion recognition and social/affective function across healthy volunteers (healthy volunteers) and schizophrenia. transcranial Interference Stimulation differs from more traditional transcranial electrical stimulation (transcranial electrical stimulation) approaches such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (transcranial alternating current stimulation) in that it uses two separate high-frequency (>1 kHz) carriers to introduce transcranial energy, and then create physiologicalrange responses at the point where the two carriers intersect, corresponding to the beat frequency between them. Here, we will use carriers that differ by 8-12 Hz (depending on the individual's alpha frequency peak), permitting modulation of alpha-frequency interactions between pulvinar nucleus and visual cortex. The study will consist of two specific aims. Under Aim 1, we will evaluate the effects of escalating transcranial Interference Stimulation intensities and repeated dosing on dynamic pulvino-cortical interaction effects on face-emotion processes in healthy volunteers using concurrent task-EEG recording and transcranial Interference Stimulation, along with the targetand frequency-specificity of the effect. We will use a face emotion recognition task in which we previously reported visual sensory and face emotion recognition differential patterns of pulvinar nucleus dysfunction and related oscillatory disturbance across schizophrenia and autism disorder spectrum and task-related EEG modulations during transcranial Interference Stimulation stimulation will be assessed. MRS read-outs will be used to assess tissue-level safety. Under Aim 2, we will conduct an RCT of 5d repeated transcranial Interference Stimulation in schizophrenia to assess its ability to correct ongoing deficits in alpha-frequency modulation during face processing, as well as its behavioral effects on face emotion recognition.

We have shown that the known mechanisms of resistance do not fully explain resistance observed among most clinical isolates. Our long-term goal is to improve antifungal therapy and ensure the sustained clinical utility of the triazole class for treatment of infections caused by Aspergillus species. Our central hypothesis is that non-cyp51A-mutation mediated mechanisms are essential to triazole resistance in clinical isolates of A. fumigatus and involve complex genetic changes altering 1) sterol biosynthesis and its transcriptional activation, 2) triazole transport and its transcriptional activation, and 3) as yet unknown mechanisms. Our current objective is to address critical knowledge gaps by identifying the genetic and molecular determinants of non-cyp51A-mutation mediated resistance. Our preliminary data suggest that while mutations in cyp51A among triazole resistant clinical isolates are common, their overall contribution to resistance is minimal. We have observed mutations, unique to resistant isolates in our collection, in genes encoding sterol sensing proteins, regulators of sterol biosynthesis, and sterol biosynthesis enzymes. We have also observed clinical isolates that overexpress not only cyp51A, but most genes of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, suggesting its constitutive activation. We have observed several potential transporters that are upregulated among triazole resistant isolates in our collection, suggesting a role for triazole efflux and resistance by these transporters. We have also shown that clinical isolates of A. fumigatus take up triazole antifungals via facilitated diffusion and we believe that altered triazole import may represent an important mechanism of resistance. To accomplish our objective we will undertake experiments that will lead to an understanding of what genetic and molecular determinants influence triazole susceptibility through altered sterol biosynthesis or its transcriptional activation (Aim 1) and triazole transport and its regulation (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will also utilize an unbiased whole genome comparisons, coupled with in vitro evolution experiments, to identify completely novel mechanisms of resistance in clinical isolates. Our approach is innovative as we will use the latest genetic and genomic techniques to study and discover novel non-cyp51A-mutation mediated mechanisms of triazole resistance that are operative in a U.S.-based collection of triazole resistant clinical isolates. The proposed research is significant as it represents a comprehensive analysis of the molecular and genetic basis of noncyp51A-mutation mediated triazole resistance in A. fumigatus and will provide novel insights into ways in which triazole activity can be improved against this important human pathogen.",5,5R01AI143197-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

In particular, little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms by which the deterioration in the extracellular matrix (extracellular matrix) reduces the fracture resistance of bone (spongy or increases fracture risk. Non-enzymatic post-translational modifications (Non-enzymatic post-translational modifications) are potential contributors to poor extracellular matrix because they accumulate in matrix proteins as fracture risk increases. Therefore, the overall goals of this project are i) to determine which Non-enzymatic post-translational modifications of collagen I, the predominant extracellular matrix protein of bone (spongy, predict bone (spongy fracture resistance and are clinically relevant in osteoporosis and ii) to establish whether non-crosslinking or crosslinking Non-enzymatic post-translational modifications contribute to a decrease in fracture resistance of bone (spongy and whether they do so via alterations in the structure and hydration of collagen I. To achieve our goals, we will first generate specimens of cortical bone (spongy (dense) and trabecular bone (spongy (spongy) using cadaveric femurs collected from both female and male donors between 50 years and 100 years of age (Aim 1a). These specimens will be comprehensively analyzed to quantify: bone (spongy mineral density, bone (spongy volume fraction, extracellular matrix-bound water, secondary structure of collagen I, mature enzymatic & non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks, integrity of collagen I fibrils, the resistance to yielding (strength), the ability to deform after yielding (toughness), the resistance to crack growth (fracture toughness), and the resistance to damage accumulation (fatigue). From adjacent bone (spongy samples, we will also extract extracellular matrix proteins including collagen I and quantify Non-enzymatic post-translational modifications at specific amino acid residues that form its triple helix using mass spectrometry. By fitting the data to statistical models, we will determine whether the levels of certain Non-enzymatic post-translational modifications help explain differences among the donors in fracture resistance, collagen fibril integrity, extracellular matrix-bound water, and spectroscopic markers of helical structure. We will also generate bone (spongy specimens from proximal femurs acquired from cadavers without osteoarthritis (osteoarthritis) and two types of orthopaedic surgical cases: total hip arthroplasty (total hip arthroplasty) for osteoarthritis and hemiarthroplasty (hemiarthroplasty) to fix a fragility fracture (Aim 1b). The specimens will be analyzed as in Aim 1a to determine whether NE-PTM levels are significantly higher while extracellular matrix-bound water and fracture resistance are significantly lower in hemiarthroplasty (osteoporosis) vs. total hip arthroplasty (osteoarthritis) or the cadaveric controls. To identify a mechanism whereby Non-enzymatic post-translational modifications lowers fracture resistance of bone (spongy, we will treat bone (spongys ex vivo to accumulate specific types of Non-enzymatic post-translational modifications (Aim 2a). Following treatment, we will assess the bone (spongys to determine which specific Non-enzymatic post-translational modifications significantly affect the fracture resistance of bone (spongy in a manner similar to that of aging as determined in Aim 1. Lastly, we will perform molecular dynamics simulations and molecular modeling of collagen I to determine how relevant Non-enzymatic post-translational modifications affect the triple helix structure and hydration (Aim 2b). Successful completion of the project would shift the paradigm of bone (spongy health from a focus on bone (spongy mass to the inclusion of pathogenic contributions from bone (spongy extracellular matrix.",5,5R01AR063157-10,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASES,15,2,0,0

One source of immune heterogeneity recently identified across recent onset Type 1 Diabetes subjects is the presence of partially exhausted CD8 T cells in subjects with beneficial response to anti-CD3 therapy (Long, et.al Science Immunology). Likewise, subjects with slower disease progression have great frequencies of islet-specific CD8 T cells with more features of exhaustion. Yet, the mechanisms underlying exhaustion in Type 1 Diabetes are not well understood. By contrast, in chronic viral settings it is well established that the IL-2/IL-15 axis is involved in differentiation and persistence and CD8 exhaustion: increased IL-2 availability prevents differentiation, while response to IL-2/IL15 is required for persistence. In Type 1 Diabetes, we published seminal studies along with others that link alterations in the IL-2/IL-15 axis with Type 1 Diabetes. Here, we find that Type 1 Diabetes subjects with lower frequencies of exhausted CD8 T cells have higher levels of CD4 IL-2 production and lower levels of IL-15 response in CD8 exhausted cells. Thus, IL2/IL-15 defects associated with Type 1 Diabetes present a unique opportunity to elucidate the role of IL-2 on CD8 exhaustion. We hypothesize that alterations in the IL-2/IL-15 axis in Type 1 Diabetes lead to decreased differentiation into islet-specific exhausted CD8 T cells and reduced persistence. We will test this hypothesis in two focused aims using samples from well curated human cohorts of established Type 1 Diabetes, preclinical Type 1 Diabetes and healthy control (healthy control) subjects, and multi-dimensional single cell approaches including mass cytometry (CyTOF), RNA-seq and ATAC-seq combined with innovative systems immunology approaches. In Aim 1, we propose to elucidate mechanisms of increased CD4 IL2 production that lead to reduced exhaustion at different stages of disease. In Aim 2, we will elucidate mechanisms of reduced IL-12/IL-15 response in exhausted CD8 T cells that results in limited persistence of exhaustion. Successful completion of these aims will 1) advance our understanding of CD8 T cell exhaustion as an understudied form of tolerance in Type 1 Diabetes, 2) improve our understanding of immune factors contributing to Type 1 Diabetes disease progression, and 3) provide the foundation for the development of therapies designed to promote exhaustion.",5,5R01AI141952-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,12,4,0,0

Recent work from the PIs of this proposal (Toneva and Wehbe, 2019; Jain and Huth, 2018) and others (Schrimpf et al., 2020a; Caucheteux & King, 2020) has shown that cortical representations of multi-word sequences can be modeled much more accurately than before by using neural network language models, a machine learning technique that has revolutionized the natural language processing (natural language processing) field (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019). However, under the current paradigm these models must first be trained on separate natural language processing tasks and only then used to model the brain, creating a guess-and-check cycle that is not guaranteed to converge on the actual computations that humans perform. Here we propose to break this cycle by directly training neural network models to estimate the functions that the brain uses to combine words. To be able to optimally predict fMRI and MEG responses, these models will need to capture the composition principles governing which words the brain attends to, and how information is combined across words. These models will help uncover specific computations underlying language processing in the brain, enable computational testing of neurolinguistic theories, and inspire or directly improve models used in natural language processing. Accomplishing these goals, however, will require overcoming one major obstacle. Training neural network language models typically requires orders of magnitude more data than existing neuroimaging datasets. To address this issue, one central goal of this proposed project is to collect a very large fMRI and MEG dataset comprising roughly one million words of natural language stimuli. We plan to use the unique dataset and computational modeling framework to address three scientific aims. Aim 1: Create brain activity prediction benchmarks to foster interaction between neuroscience and natural language processing. Aim 2: Use data-driven models to test existing neurolinguistic theories & develop new accounts of the computations underlying word composition in the brain. Aim 3: Leverage information in different brain areas to help solve computationally defined language tasks. Successful completion of the proposed work will provide mechanistic insight into language processing, with a computational architecture tracing information flow among brain areas and describing the tasks they perform. Beyond its basic cognitive neuroscience implications, we expect this work will enable better understanding of language impairments and help identify targeted therapies. Through collecting, analyzing, and disseminating large-scale neuroimaging datasets collected while participants listen to natural, narrative speech, this proposal aims to improve our understanding of the normal function of the language system. Specifically, this work seeks to improve and validate computational models of speech language processing in the human brain.",5,5R01DC020088-04,PAR-21-005,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,0,1,5,1

Most Active Case Finding conducted by national tuberculosis control programs is based on testing household contacts, CC (household contacts, CC) of remotely-acquired but newly-diagnosed cases of TB disease. This approach typically detects previously undiagnosed TB disease in 2-4% of household contacts, CC. We propose to test an entirely new method of Active Case Finding based on testing household contacts, CC of adolescents with recently-acquired and newly-diagnosed TB infection. This innovative method of Active Case Finding has the advantage that, since infections were recently acquired, the source cases are likely still among the close contacts, CC of the new interferon gamma release assay convertor. For this reason, we hypothesize that a source case will be found for as many as 50% of these new convertors. This approach is based on results of our recent 3-year study of serial testing for TB infection among 650 adolescent schoolchildren in Tanzania. The study was based on annual testing for TB infection using an interferon gamma release assay (interferon gamma release assay). We showed that such testing was feasible and detected a 2.9% annual rate of infection. In the proposed new 5-year study we will perform baseline interferon gamma release assay testing on 1200 Tanzanian adolescents followed by Q4 month interferon gamma release assay testing x4 on the estimated 1020 who are interferon gamma release assay negative at baseline. We anticipate detecting new TB infection (interferon gamma release assay conversion to positive) in 50 participants. We will then test 200 of their household and other close contacts, CC (collectively, their close contacts, CC, CC) and predict that we will identify a source case of previously undiagnosed TB in a minimum of 25 or 50% of these 50 new adolescent infections. The predicted rate of new TB disease detection among CCs is therefore 25/200 or 12.5%, which is 3-6 times higher than the current approach for testing household contacts, CC of patients with TB disease. Cost-effectiveness will be analyzed and compared to the current approach used by the National Program on Tuberculosis and Leprosy. Successful completion of the proposed study with the hypothesized outcomes has the potential for a major impact on global tuberculosis outcomes. It is expected that the numerous new point-of-care interferon gamma release assay tests under development will make serial testing feasible and economical at a programmatic level in low income countries.

Functions of the apical junctional complex include regulation of paracellular flux, cell-cell adhesion, and mechanotransduction. Despite evidence that the umbrella cell apical junctional complex is integral to urothelial function and disrupted in several lower urinary tract disorders, we have limited understanding of key aspects of umbrella cell apical junctional complex biology and pathobiology including: (i) how the apical junctional complex maintains its continuity in the face of cyclical bladder filling and voiding; (ii) how the apical junctional complex is organized to undergo these transitions and the function of the cytoskeleton in these events; and (iii) how the umbrella cell apical junctional complex senses tension and whether pathologically high intravesical pressures stimulate apical junctional complex-associated mechanotransduction pathways. Our preliminary studies include the novel findings that during bladder filling the apical junctional complex perimeter expands dramatically, a process that depends on changes in the actin cytoskeleton and vesicular traffic, likely directed toward the apical junctional complex. In contrast, the apical junctional complex contracts soon after bladder voiding, events driven by the non-muscle myosin II-triggered contraction of the actin cytoskeleton, RhoA, as well as endocytosis. Based on available data, we hypothesize that critical functions of the umbrella cell apical junctional complex are to maintain urothelial barrier function by undergoing dynamic expansion and contraction and to serve as a site of mechanotransduction under normal and pathological conditions. To test this global hypothesis, we propose the following experiments. In Aim 1, we will use a newly developed biaxial stretching device, coupled with live-cell image analysis, to determine if increased strain triggers exocytosis of junction-associated proteins directed toward the apical junctional complex, and if release of strain stimulates their endocytosis. We will also assess if blocking apical junctional complex expansion perturbs urothelial barrier function. In Aim 2, we will focus on deciphering the function and organization of the umbrella cell apical junctional complex-associated cytoskeleton. We will use super-resolution confocal imaging, as well as electron microscopy to reconstruct the umbrella cell apical junctional complex in 3D. In addition, we will determine if formins drive actin polymerization in response to filling. In Aim 3, we will use tension sensors to determine if transmembrane proteins associated with the umbrella cell apical junctional complex sense force, and assess whether junction-associated signaling pathways are activated in response to partial bladder outlet obstruction (partial bladder outlet obstruction). Upon completion of these studies we will have new insights into how umbrella cell apical junctional complex dynamics contribute to urothelial barrier function, the organization of the apical junctional complex and the function of its associated cytoskeleton, and important new information about how the apical junctional complex senses and responds to perturbations in its mechanical milieu, including in response to partial bladder outlet obstruction.",5,5R01DK129473-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,5,7,2,0

Malfunctions of temporal association learning represent welldescribed findings in human patients suffering from schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. There are several critical gaps in our knowledge of current theoretical model and neurobiological evidence about mechanisms of temporal association learning. My long-term goal is to elucidate the neural mechanisms that drive and regulate temporal association learning by understanding neural circuits and their neural processes in entorhinal cortical-hippocampal (entorhinal cortical-hippocampal) networks, using Pavlovian trace fear conditioning (trace fear conditioning) as the behavioral paradigm. We previously demonstrated that pOxr1+ excitatory cells in the medial entorhinal cortex layer III (pOxr1+ cells) project to the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and are necessary for trace fear conditioning. On the other hand, some CalB+ excitatory cells in MECII (CalB+ excitatory cells in MECII) project to GABAergic neurons in hippocampal CA1, suppress the MECIII input into the CA1 pyramidal cells through the feed-forward inhibition, and inhibit trace fear conditioning. These findings lead us to propose a disinhibition model to regulate trace fear conditioning, driving trace fear conditioning by pOxr1+ cells and regulating trace fear conditioning by CalB+ excitatory cells in MECII. The central hypothesis of this model is that successful trace fear conditioning depends on learning-dependent disinhibition of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells through the reduction of feed-forward inhibition mediated by CalB+ excitatory cells in MECII. Towards this hypothesis, we have identified that pOxr1+ cells show tone-induced sustained neural activity in all trials during trace fear conditioning, while CalB+ excitatory cells in MECII show trial-dependent reduction of the tone-induced sustained neural activity. We have also discovered that the CalB+ excitatory cells in MECII specifically express dopamine D1 receptors (D1 receptors) in MEC and the activation D1 receptors in MEC is essential for the learning-dependent reduction of the c-Fos expression in CalB+ excitatory cells in MECII and for successful trace fear conditioning. Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three Specific Aims to examine neural circuit mechanism that drive and regulate trace fear conditioning:  To define the roles of pOxr1+ cells and CalB+ excitatory cells in MECII for trace fear conditioning.  To determine the role of D1 receptors activation in CalB+ excitatory cells in MECII for trace fear conditioning.  To elucidate the role of dopaminergic inputs into the MEC for trace fear conditioning. Collectively, our proposed research will broadly impact the field of learning and memory by characterizing novel neural circuits and their neural process that drive and regulate temporal association memory in entorhinal cortical-hippocampal networks. Our proposed studies will uncover neural substrates for temporal association memory and novel learning-dependent gatekeeper circuits for the regulation of temporal association learning, and potentially, the circuit mechanism can be a pharmaceutical new target for preventing inadequate memory formation.",5,5R01MH120134-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,5,1

Defects in sensory processing and behavior selection are commonly observed in neuro-psychiatric conditions including anxiety, autism (ASD), and schizophrenia (schizophrenia). Despite the biological and clinical relevance, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating these processes is limited, in part due to the intricate and dynamic circuitry involved in complex human decision-making. The etiology of sensory processing disorders remains equivocal; however, it is hypothesized that intrinsic/genetic, extrinsic/environmental and the interactions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors can play fundamental roles. Understanding the genetic components of environmental triggered response is critical in understanding the overall impact of the environment on organisms, including humans. Many environmental changes show differential response within populations of individuals due to genetic differences in the affected pathways. In parallel, many environmental pollutants have a range of adverse neuro-health outcomes and despite increasing recognition of the importance of evaluating neurotoxicity in safety assessment, tens of thousands of commercial chemicals in current use, have not been evaluated. In this R21 proposal we investigate how gene by environmental interactions (GxE) impact developmental neurotoxicity linked to sensory processing deficits and neuro-psychiatric conditions later in life. We utilize the Medaka Inbred Kiyosu-Karlsruhe (Medaka Inbred Kiyosu-Karlsruhe) Panel to test the hypothesis that there are common pathways of environmental contaminant response across vertebrates, and that the majority of these pathways have segregating genetic variation contributing to polygenic GxE effects of contaminant responses. The Medaka Inbred Kiyosu-Karlsruhe panel consists of 80 nearisogenic inbred lines, currently inbred for 22 generations, with fully sequenced genomes and transcriptome. Both molecular and organismal phenotypes are distinguishable, and molecular traits can be mapped to specific loci. We propose that the Medaka Inbred Kiyosu-Karlsruhe panel will provide unique insights into GxE components of developmental neurotoxicity and sensory processing behaviors related to neuropsychiatric conditions. Advances in developmental toxicity studies using zebrafish and medaka, key biomedical model species, have provided insights using larval behavioral studies. The high relative fecundity of teleost models, as compared to mice, as well as the regulatory advantages to using an earlier-diverging vertebrate (reducing the use of animals in research) provides additional incentives to developing these methods.

Continued existence of this gap represents an important problem for the 40%-80% of cisplatin-treated cancer patients who suffer with significant and in some cases permanent hearing loss as a result of cisplatin use. Until the underlying nitrative stress mechanism is delineated the promise of this new interventional target for mitigating a dose-limiting side-effect of cisplatin likely will remain unrealized. The long-term goal is to better understand the functional as well as mechanistic role of cochlear nitrative stress in acquired hearing loss. The objective is to delineate signaling pathways by which cisplatin-induced nitrative stress, particularly nitration of cochlear LMO4, facilitates ototoxicity, because cisplatin treatment nitrates and downregulates LMO4 protein. LMO4 is a transcriptional regulator that controls pathways regulating cell survival and cell death. The central hypothesis is that cisplatin-induced nitrative stress downregulates cochlear LMO4 and compromises STAT3mediated anti-apoptotic signaling to facilitate ototoxicity. Understanding the mechanisms whereby nitrated cochlear LMO4 promotes cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is likely to contribute to the development of strategies to prevent this debilitating adverse effect. Guided by strong preliminary data this study will pursue three specific aims:  establish the causal link between cisplatin-induced LMO4 nitration and ototoxicity;  determine the effects of cisplatin-induced LMO4 nitration on JAK/STAT signaling; and  determine the otoprotective efficacy of pharmacological inhibition of nitration. In Aim 1, cisplatin-induced apoptosis will be analyzed after blocking nitration of LMO4 by site-directed mutagenesis and inhibiting proteasomal degradation of nitrated-LMO4 by lactacystin. The link between LMO4 protein levels and cisplatin-induced ototoxicity will be ascertained by testing cochlear apoptosis/hearing loss in LMO4 knockout and overexpressing mice. In Aim 2, cisplatininduced changes in protein-protein interactions of cochlear LMO4 will be analyzed using a mass spectrometrybased proteomics approach while JAK/STAT related apoptotic and inflammatory signaling will be analyzed using targeted gene arrays. In Aim 3, the otoprotective efficacy of SRI110, a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, will be assessed using CBA/J mice; potential interference of SRI110 with anti-cancer activity of cisplatin will be analyzed using SCID mice. This innovative research departs from the status quo by shifting the focus from oxidative stress to the pivotal role of nitrative stress in cisplatin ototoxicity. Significantly, outcomes are expected to vertically advance understanding of how nitrative stress regulates cochlear apoptosis in cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.

Dr. Pozzi's Katz R01 (parent), and somatosensory project, AR080058) approaches this problem by examining the neural and somatosensory aspects (neuroimaging, central sensitization, psychosocial distress) of symptoms in well-characterized cohorts of symptomatic tears, asymptomatic tears, and healthy controls (no tears, no pain). We have a unique window of opportunity to submit an ancillary project that evaluates the musculoskeletal aspects of symptoms, specifically neuromuscular control and glenohumeral joint health, in the same cohorts as the parent), and somatosensory project. The high prevalence of individuals with asymptomatic rotator cuff tears as well as the success of some conservative exercise interventions for symptomatic tears suggests neuromuscular control strategies can mitigate symptoms. However, since the anatomical integrity of the torn tendon is not restored, to what extent previously identified changes of neuromuscular control are adaptive versus pathological remains unknown. Current investigation on the interaction between rotator cuff tears and glenohumeral joint health are limited to murine models, radiographic imaging studies, and studies characterizing end-stage disease (i.e., co-presence of massive tears and glenohumeral osteoarthritis). We will advance this prior work through three aims. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the interrelationship between neuromuscular control and symptom expression in individuals with rotator cuff tears by simultaneously measuring shoulder motion) and electromyography (EMG (including scapular motion) and electromyography (EMG) and electromyography (electromyography) of shoulder muscles (including intramuscular electromyography of rotator cuff muscles) during functional tasks. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the interrelationship between neuromuscular control, symptom expression, and shoulder joint health in individuals with rotator cuff tear using static (magnetic resonance imaging to characterize cartilage) and dynamic (musculoskeletal simulations to calculate glenohumeral joint forces) measures. In Aim 3, we will explore potential treatment targets by leveraging recent advances in explainable artificial intelligence to evaluate the relative contributions of various organ systems to rotator cuff symptoms. The organ systems evaluated in the parent), and somatosensory (nervous and somatosensory systems) and ancillary (musculoskeletal system) projects will be explicitly studied. Completing this ancillary project will advance our knowledge of the musculoskeletal factors that influence patient outcomes. Integrated analyses of the musculoskeletal (ancillary), neural (parent), and somatosensory), and somatosensory (parent), and somatosensory) contributions to symptom expression will further elucidate the biological mechanisms driving outcomes, thereby aiding the identification of rotator cuff tear phenotypes and treatment targets.",1,1R01AR084273-01,PAR-23-025,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASES,15,2,0,0

Vascular disease is found in approximately 80% of patients with concomitant Alzheimer's disease pathology and thus may be an important contributor to the development of Alzheimer's disease, however relationships between vascular health and the emergence of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology has not yet been comprehensively investigated in cognitively normal samples. While large vascular adverse events such as stroke are known to confer risk for developing vascular dementia, growing evidence suggests that subtle vascular damage accrued through a lifetime of injury could predispose neural structure and function to become more susceptible to Alzheimer's disease-related pathophysiology. Critically, chronic and subtle forms of vascular disease are more commonly found in Black and Hispanic populations with reduced access to healthcare and could help explain the increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in these populations. The goal of this renewal project is to establish the role of cerebrovascular injury and dysfunction (cerebrovascular injury and dysfunction) in the pathophysiology of preclinical Alzheimer's disease and develop individualized imaging-based cerebrovascular profiles that predict memory decline across racially and ethnically diverse populations. We will conduct follow-up assessments in 100 nondemented older adults (over 60 years of age) in our current award (BEACoN Cohort: R01AG053555), which includes amyloid-PET (florbetapir), serial high-resolution MRI and tau-PET (MK-6240), our innovative digital cognitive biomarkers which assess pattern separation, and a full UDS-3 neuropsychological testing battery. We will complement this with targeted new recruitment (n = 100) to increase the representation of Hispanic/Latino and Black participants in our cohort. We have built an infrastructure to radically transform recruitment and retention in our study including innovative partnerships with clinical research organizations with a demonstrable track record in minority recruitment. Given focus on subtle vascular damage, we will exclude based on history of stroke or severe cardiovascular disease. Our aims are  Assess the novel biomarker framework in which cerebrovascular injury and dysfunction predicts tau accumulation, which predicts structural and functional deterioration of the medial temporal lobes (medial temporal lobes), subsequently predicting decline in hippocampal pattern separation.  Construct individualized brain imaging based cerebrovascular injury and dysfunction profiles that differentially predict decline in hippocampal memory across racially and ethnically diverse populations.  Aim 3: Associate cerebrovascular injury and dysfunction profiles with modifiable lifestyle risk factors and structural and social determinants of health that are differentially distributed across racial and ethnic groups. In summary, we will develop a novel mechanistic framework for how cerebrovascular injury and dysfunction contributes to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and memory/cognitive decline that directly addresses racial and ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease risk. Cerebrovascular profiles, and their associated modifiable risk factors that confer the greatest risk of Alzheimer's disease, will be identified as targets for future intervention.",5,5R01AG053555-07,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,2,6,6,1

Walking and turning dysfunction appear early in Parkinson's disease and use of inertial sensors to measure walking and turning may provide sensitive, objective markers of disease progression as well as of decline in quality of life. New wearable technology can provide reliable, objective measures of walking and turning that are feasible for clinical trials. However, quantifying walking and turning during unsupervised, daily life has the untapped potential to provide objective measures that are even more sensitive to disease progression, to quality of life and fall risk than current subjective clinical measures of mobility. We predict that turning quality may be even more sensitive to progression of disease in early Parkinson's disease, than straight walking because of the added dynamic balance challenges. Aim I will determine the most sensitive measures of mobility (daily life) in 100 people with early, untreated Parkinson's disease and 50 older control subjects. We hypothesize that unsupervised daily life mobility measures will be sensitive and specific for early Parkinson's disease. Aim II will determine the measures of mobility in daily life most sensitive to disease progression. We hypothesize that turning characteristics during daily life (particularly variability of performance) will be the most sensitive mobility measures to change over 3 years in recently diagnosed people with Parkinson's disease. Aim III will predict future falls based on daily life objective measures of walking and turning. We hypothesize that objective measures of daily life gait and turning quality will significantly improve prediction of who will fall and time-to-first-fall compared to clinical measures (i.e., fall risk). Identification of the most sensitive set of measures of mobility disability progression during real life activities with wearable technology will provide quantifiable and objective outcome measures for testing the effectiveness of new disease-modifying therapies.

Knowledge of the molecules that are produced in each embryonic cell is essential to understanding their function to pattern the embryonic body. Decades of innovative cell biological and embryological studies, assessment of function one gene at a time, and recently deep transcriptomics profiling via next-generation sequencing have exposed the developmental roles of important genes, transcripts, and some proteins. As a result, scientists have defined the spatial and temporal changes of mRNAs and abundant proteins, and some serendipitously identified metabolites of importance, such as folate assisting in closure of the neural tube. However, it has been technologically impossible to utilize high-resolution mass spectrometry (high-resolution mass spectrometry), the gold standard technology for proteomics and metabolomics (`omics), to study hundreds of metabolites and thousands proteins in single embryonic cells in the vertebrate embryo. Further, in developing systems, a complex correlation between gene transcription and translation as well as posttranslational modifications complicate the use of mRNA information to approximate protein and metabolite levels. Without the availability of single-cell high-resolution mass spectrometry as a routine laboratory tool or other technologies capable of deep metabolomics and proteomics, scientists at present lack insights into metabolic processes that contribute to early embryonic patterning. The research program proposed here fills this enormous knowledge and technological gap by utilizing ultrahigh-sensitivity high-resolution mass spectrometry platforms that were custom-designed, custom-built, and validated in the vertebrate frog (Xenopus laevis) embryo, a popular model in cell/developmental biology, to understand noncanonical metabolomic processes that control formation of the germ layers. Most recently, single-cell high-resolution mass spectrometry in X. laevis has discovered metabolites that are capable of (i) altering the normal cell fates of embryonic cells, (ii) communicating between blastomeres, and (iii) affecting the whole-organismal performance of the resulting tadpole. These findings have shed light on a gap in our basic knowledge of molecules participating in the successful induction of the germ layers. This research program will determine roles that metabolites play in patterning the embryonic body plan. This work will integrate classical embryological manipulations, cell-fate tracking, and fluorescent microscopy with new-generation quantitative mass spectrometry capable of subcellular sensitivity to characterize how targeted metabolic reactions impact reproducible tissue fates in the X. laevis embryo. Because these molecular processes are highly conserved across vertebrates, the data collected from Xenopus are likely to have high relevance to human development.

10928266,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/fqhtVlLMQ0aYuqRJfKxVhg/project-details/10928266#similar-Projects,Repression via Facultative Heterochromatin,"A critical question in the field of Epigenetics/Mammalian Gene Regulation is how a cellular identity is inherited by progeny cells during cell division. This fundamental aspect of epigenetic regulation was recently clarified in our lab: repressed, but not active, chromatin domains are inherited. Repressed chromatin domains in facultative heterochromatin are maintained by the multi-subunit complex, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2), that catalyzes the histone post-translational modification, H3K27me3. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 exhibits a notable ""read and write"" feature whereby its recognition of H3K27me3 results in its allosteric activation. Thus, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 can fully restore repressive chromatin domains upon inheritance of H3K27me3-nucleosomes. Remarkably, our findings point to a previously reported histone chaperone, NPM1, as facilitating this inheritance of repressed chromatin: NPM1 is exclusively localized to chromatin in late S-phase when repressed chromatin is replicated, and interacts directly with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. Our latest findings demonstrated specific de-repression of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2-regulated genes upon auxinmediated depletion of NPM1 during S-phase of the cell cycle. We will expand our mechanistic studies of epigenetic inheritance by investigating the role of NPM1 as an S-phase-specific histone chaperone and its interplay with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 in a series of histone chaperone assays performed in vitro with distinct candidate oligonucleosomal templates. We will investigate the role of NPM1 in epigenetic inheritance by adapting our in vivo assay for chromatin domain inheritance as a function of the presence of NPM1 and pertinent NPM1 mutants. The interactive dynamics of NPM1 and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 in the context of a replication fork is critical information towards understanding the transfer of parental nucleosomes to daughter DNA strands. Thus, single-molecule localization microscopy as well as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy) are expected to bear directly on the role of NPM1 and the significance of its interaction with the epigenetic regulator, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2. Importantly, mutant NPM1c associated with ~35% of all Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (Acute Myelogenous Leukemia) is mis-localized to the cytoplasm. We propose that NPM1c hampers normal Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 function. Indeed, similar to our findings above upon NPM1 depletion, known HOX gene targets of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 are aberrantly expressed in NPM1c Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, participating in the establishment of the leukemic state. Deposition of H3K27me3 by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and DNA methylation by DNMT3A result in repressed chromatin, but are usually mutually exclusive. Yet, NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations synergize in leukemogenesis. Thus, we further propose that DNMT3A partially compensates for our proposed NPM1cmediated thwarting of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2⏤which is lost upon DNMT3A mutation. Through temporal expression of NPM1c as a function of the presence of mutant DNMT3A, we will track the repercussions to gene expression, features of repressed chromatin domains, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 chromatin occupancy and DNA methylation in both tissue culture and a mouse model of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia to fully grasp the sequence of aberrant epigenetic events as they occur in leukemogenesis.",5,5R01CA199652-21,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,10,10,2,4

Non-invasive quantitative imaging would be a powerful tool to understand mechanisms of action and failure of T cell immunotherapies, evaluate the impact of T cell modifications and delivery routes, monitor off-target T cell accumulation, and stratify response to therapy on the basis of measures of T cell tumor accumulation. This Bioengineering Research Grant project will pioneer non-invasive and quantitative tracking of adoptive T cell cancer immunotherapy using magnetic particle imaging (magnetic particle imaging), a new molecular imaging modality that enables non-invasive, unambiguous, and tomographic analysis of the whole-body distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles). Preliminary results demonstrate non-invasive quantitative tracking of adoptive cell transfer T cells in solid intracranial tumors, synthesis of tracers with enhanced magnetic particle imaging sensitivity, and current sensitivity of 5x103 T cells. The proposed work aims to improve sensitivity to 5x102 T cells and demonstrate the accuracy of magnetic particle imaging in quantifying T cell biodistribution in mouse models of cancer. Modeling of magnetic particle imaging physics by the physics demonstrates that tracers optimal for magnetic particle imaging must have uniform physical and magnetic properties and low magnetocrystalline anisotropy, to enable fast dipole switching at large SphysicsON diameters. The physics has developed a new synthesis that yields defect-free superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with uniform magnetic properties and low magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The proposed work (Aim 1) will couple this new synthesis with modeling of magnetic particle imaging physics and comprehensive physical and magnetic characterization to gain fundamental understanding of the relation between SphysicsON properties and magnetic particle imaging performance and to obtain superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with superior sensitivity. Imaging approaches to track T cells must not compromise their viability or function and T cells pose unique challenges for nanoparticle labeling. The proposed work (Aim 2) will define an upper limit for labeling primary T cells with magnetic particle imaging tracers without compromising viability or function using tracers that associate with T cells through charge interactions. Preliminary studies demonstrate non-invasive tracking of T cell biodistribution in mice using magnetic particle imaging, and that SphysicsON-labeled T cells reach solid tumors after systemic administration in murine models. The proposed work (Aim 3) will validate in vivo tracking of adoptive cell transfer T cell therapy using magnetic particle imaging against T cell counting using flow cytometry and will evaluate dynamics of T cell accumulation in tumors longitudinally using magnetic particle imaging. The proposed biomaterials-development research plan is enabled by the complementary expertise of the physics (superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and magnetic particle imaging physics) and Co-I (adoptive cell transfer T cell therapies) and access to state-of-the-art instrumentation to characterize SphysicsON magnetic particle imaging performance ex vivo and in vivo. Achieving the target sensitivity of 5x102 T cells will provide an order-ofmagnitude improvement in quantitative cell tracking sensitivity over other whole body quantitative imaging technologies, establishing magnetic particle imaging as a powerful tool in the immunoimaging toolbox.",5,5R01EB031224-03,PAR-19-158,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING,17,0,4,4

The Patient Sampling and Genomics Core (Core D) will perform the central function of collecting these Mφ samples and establishing and maintaining a clinical database of disease severity. Feasibility for obtaining sufficient samples for the proposed studies will be greatly enhanced through extensive utilization of a non-bronchoscopic BAL (non-bronchoscopic BAL) approach, which results in diagnostic yields similar to bronchoscopic BAL and has an excellent safety profile in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In addition, blood will be collected for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) for comparison with lung samples. Longitudinal samples will be collected from a subset of patients. Additionally, Core D will provide biostatistical analysis on these clinical samples as well as bioinformatic analysis on samples from all Projects, including bulk RNA-seq analysis, and single-cell RNA-seq (single-cell RNA-seq) processing and analysis, as described in the individual Projects. A spectrum of clinical severity will be obtained to correlate disease outcomes with flow cytometric, transcriptomic, and functional analyses of Mφs, focusing on pathways relevant to each of the four Projects. Innovative aspects of this Core include the following: a) development of an unique biorepository of lung Mφ samples from patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, including longitudinal samples from a subset of patients to characterize changes in lung Mφ populations during the phases of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; b) single-cell RNA-seq analysis of patient lung Mφ, representing a substantial methodological advance in Mφ analysis compared to other recent studies; c) extensive utilization of the non-bronchoscopic BAL approach to greatly enhance sample collection since it can be performed safely and with high yield by respiratory therapists and fellow trainees; d) an integrated Core structure that combines patient sample acquisition with biostatistical and bioinformatic expertise and resources to maximize efficient utilization of these clinical data; e) sample collection from a diverse ICU patient population of under-represented and insufficiently studied groups (30-40% African-American and 30-40% Hispanic/Latino patients). f) Comparison of expression profiles in lung Mφ populations from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome patients with circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells after removal of lymphocytes, which will improve the reported poor correlation between these sample types; g) inclusion of immune paralysis as phenotypic characterization of patient samples, which has not been evaluated in past studies of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome AMφ clinical samples; h) enhanced focus on sepsis and pneumonia-induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome as the primary etiologies characterized by intensive lung Mφ analysis.",5,5P01HL151327-04,PAR-18-405,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",13,4,7,2

This is a significant issue considering that the majority of patients diagnosed with breast cancer and that experience metastatic relapse have HR+ tumors. Metastatic spread occurs early, often prior to the detection of the primary mass, and is facilitated by crosstalk between the tissue and developing tumor. This gives rise to the possibility that differences in the normal tissue environment exist which enhance the risk for metastatic disease. However, the mechanisms through which changes arise in the mammary tissue environment and their contributions to metastatic breast cancer remain largely undefined. We recently established gut commensal dysbiosis, defined as an inflammatory microbiome with low biodiversity, enhances metastasis of HR+ tumors. Establishing dysbiosis prior to tumor initiation significantly enhanced dissemination of tumor cells into the blood, distal lymph nodes, and lungs, with no impact upon primary tumor growth. Dysbiosis enhanced the accumulation of mast cells into the normal mammary tissue of non-tumor-bearing mice, whereas inhibition of mast cell degranulation significantly reduced metastatic dissemination. These results indicated an important role for tissue-associated mast cells in the promotion of breast tumor dissemination. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that blockade of CCL2 prior to tumor initiation is sufficient to reduce mast cell accumulation in the mammary tissue and to diminish dysbiosis-induced dissemination of HR+ tumor cells. The goal of this proposal is to define how gut commensal dysbiosis distally orchestrates cellular and molecular changes in normal mammary tissues of non-tumor-bearing mice that enhance susceptibility to HR+ tumor dissemination. Aim 1 will define how commensal dysbiosis distally changes the normal (non-tumor-bearing) mammary tissue immune environment to favor early HR+ tumor dissemination. We will integrate a variety of approaches to investigate the link between the gut microbiome, host metabolism, and metastatic breast cancer. Aim 2 will establish how mast cells promote early dissemination of HR+ tumors. The goal of this aim will be to define how mast cells are activated in mammary tissues of mice with dysbiosis and establish how mast cells initiate metastasis of HR+ tumors through interactions with tissue fibroblasts and macrophages. These mechanistic studies will have the potential to unveil novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of metastatic breast cancer, targets that could be identifiable prior to a tumor diagnosis. Considering the role of the gut commensal dysbiosis, modification of microbiome or targeting of commensal-associated metabolites emerges as a potential low cost therapeutic to prevent or reduce the incidence of metastatic breast cancer.",5,5R01CA262634-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

We will explore a novel anti-cancer approach against castration-resistant prostate cancer (castration-resistant prostate cancer) that entails activation of a pro-drug conjugate specifically in tumor tissue leading to cancer cell ablation without imposing off-targets toxicity. The approach is based on a 2021 report by Tanaka & colleagues that a drug-conjugated aryl azide reacts with endogenous acrolein molecules that are abundant in cancer but not normal tissue. This bioorthogonal reaction in cancer cells, based on click chemistry, leads to rearrangement of the reaction product and drug release. We will utilize this drug release principle in a preclinical study to target castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by BO-264 and its more potent derivatives, which are small-molecule anti-cancer agents & drug candidates, and by docetaxel & cabazitaxel - the chemotherapy drugs for clinical castration-resistant prostate cancer. Acrolein, a 3-carbon unsaturated aldehyde, is copiously produced in cancer cells due to abnormal metabolism and oxidative stress. BO-264, identified from a chemical library screen, inhibits TACC3, a centrosome-associated protein which regulates chromosome segregation. TACC3 is elevated in prostate cancer and other solid tumors. This project is a collaboration of PI's lab with Co-PI's synthetic chemistry lab. Novel aryl azide conjugates of biologics and chemotherapeutics, synthesized by the Co-PI's lab, will be examined for impacts on castration-resistant prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo in mouse xenograft & allograft in PI's lab. Prelim data shows dose-dependent increasing susceptibility of the PC3 castration-resistant prostate cancer cells to the azide conjugate of BO-264, synthesized in-house. Non-cancer RWPE-1 prostate cells were unaffected. PC3 cells showed ~ 7-fold higher acrolein than RWPE-1. Sp. Aim 1: Synthesize at high yields aryl azide conjugates of the above-noted anti-cancer biologics & taxanes using novel synthesis strategies and characterize the end products. The products will be characterized by NMR, IR, HRMS, X-ray. Derivatives of BO-264, not available commercially, will be synthesized. Sp. Aim 2: Investigate activated drugs/biologics, released from conjugates, for effects on human & mouse castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, and on castration-resistant prostate cancer xenograft/allograft tumors in mice. Conjugate-treated cells in culture and tumors will be assayed for proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, EMT, AR, and for AKT & ERK activation. For androgen receptor (AR)-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer, combined effects of enzalutamide (AR inhibitor) and an azide conjugate will be probed.

The gallbladder is the primary bacterial reservoir for several enteric pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and Campylobacter, and serves as the source of fecally secreted bacteria that has the potential to increase transmission of these foodborne pathogens. Here, we will dissect the nature of Listeria monocytogenes growth in the gallbladder and identify the bacterial metabolic and stress response pathways critical for colonization of the murine gallbladder. To that end, we present preliminary data from our novel ex vivo model of Listeria monocytogenes gallbladder colonization using organs from non-human primates (non-human primates). These results have set the stage for investigations into specific genes and pathways necessary for Listeria monocytogenes replication in the gallbladder lumen. The objectives of this proposal will be accomplished with three Specific Aims:  Define the gallbladder as a replicative niche for Listeria monocytogenes. To do this, we will determine the localization of Listeria monocytogenes in the gallbladder and define the metabolites available in the gallbladder lumen.  Identify the Listeria monocytogenes genes required for colonization of the gallbladder. Here, fluorescent reporter strains will be engineered to identify the Listeria monocytogenes signaling pathways that are activated in the gallbladder during infection. Additionally, we will evaluate specific Listeria monocytogenes genes and pathways for their roles in pathogenesis, with a focus on gallbladder colonization.  Determine the role of the immune response to Listeria monocytogenes ∆rex infection. Our approach is technically innovative as it takes advantage of our novel model of non-human primates gallbladder colonization to globally assess bacterial genes important for replication in this unique niche.

It is well recognized that odors have a strong effect on animal behavior, as they guide food search, maternal bonding, and mate selection. Even though humans do not consider olfaction to be a dominant sense, humans are similarly swayed by the rewarding properties of odors. With recent developments in the pattern-based analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) data and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, we are now in a position to explore the neural mechanisms of olfactory reward in humans. During the previous funding cycle, we gained key insights into how odor rewards are represented in orbitofrontal cortex (orbitofrontal cortex), and how the dopaminergic midbrain may support these representations. The objective of the current renewal application is to capitalize on these novel methods in order to address new questions arising from these initial findings about the neural mechanisms of odor-guided behavior in humans. Specifically, we will use orbitofrontal cortex-targeted transcranial magnetic stimulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and novel behavioral tasks that involve food odors as rewards to reveal the specific contribution of different orbitofrontal cortex networks to decision making. Moreover, the proposed studies will combine network-based transcranial magnetic stimulation with pattern-based functional magnetic resonance imaging to elucidate the neural mechanisms that drive learning about the identity of future odor rewards. Complementary studies will examine how one's motivational state modulates perceptional and neural responses to food odors, such that they can aid the detection of biologically relevant rewards in the environment. Together the experiments proposed in this project will fundamentally extend our understanding of olfactory reward processing in the human brain at the functional and mechanistic level, with implications for neuroscientific research on learning, memory, and behavior in general. Moreover, the findings from this work can lead to a better understanding of the behavioral deficits described in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including Schizophrenia, eating disorders, and addiction, and may ultimately provide insights into the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",5,5R01DC015426-09,PA-20-184,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,0,1,5,1

Currently, several chemical latency reversing agents have been described, however, their in vivo efficacy has not been demonstrated. Thus, the need for new approaches to address this issue is urgently needed. One attractive method to combat HIV latency, would be a self-sustaining curative to endlessly surveil the host rapidly killing newly activated reservoir cells before the release of a significant amount of virus. Previously, T cells transduced to express CD4 on their surface linked to activation signaling machinery, chimeric antigen receptor (chimeric antigen receptor) T cells, were employed to target and kill infected host cells. But there were substantial drawbacks with this approach, including a novel entry route for infection of CD8 T cells, shielding of the CD4-binding site, and lack of efficacy. Utilizing secreted high-affinity anti-HIV bnAbs, which are remarkably effective across a wide swath of HIV strains, in conjunction with superior chimeric antigen receptor designs, we here propose to exploit both advancements to generate doubly immunotherapeutic improved chimeric antigen receptor T cells. These pioneering studies will provide new insights into how to access and control the reservoir of latently HIV-infected cells and, in combination with ART, address the exigent goal of functional control of HIV. Upon completion of this project, we expect to have several validated chimeric antigen receptor T cell constructs ready for future testing in SHIV non-human primate models and/or perhaps humans. Since these studies utilize autologous T cells, we expect to see very few adverse events. Moreover, if successful, life-long use of anti-retrovirals, which have been associated with toxicity, is likely to be reduced or perhaps eliminated by this approach.",5,5R01AI150381-06,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

Given the recent advancements in single-cell and spatial genomics, along with the amassed cell atlas of embryogenesis, the creation of in silico models for entire mammalian embryogenesis-a long-sought goal in computational biology-seems attainable. Nevertheless, two pivotal gaps remain:  To capture the intricate and multi-faceted nature of embryogenesis, a cost-effective technology is requisite-one capable of profiling entire embryos at a single-cell level with high temporal resolution in 3D space.  To build the in silico model from the massive, high-dimensional datasets, we require powerful machine learning techniques adept at directly learning complex data-driven models and at making non-trivial predictions. In this proposal, I aim to construct the first-ever foundational in silico model of whole-embryo mouse embryogenesis. To begin, I will utilize Ultima's innovative and cost-efficient ""mostly natural sequencing-bysynthesis"" chemistry, combined with its ultra-high field of view wafer disc platform, to establish a large-scale 3D multi-omics cell atlas of mouse embryogenesis from E6.5 to E16.5. This will involve one-day intervals and incorporate a total of 50 million cells. The versatility of Ultima's UG100 platform allows us to couple it with RNA metabolic labeling, CRISPR-Cas9 based lineage tracing, and multi-omics, thereby producing a comprehensive, high-definition, 3D cell atlas of mouse embryogenesis. Subsequently, I plan to devise sophisticated temporal modeling techniques for learning multi-scale, multi-modal RNA velocity vector fields. Focusing on the spatial aspect, I will devise a RNA signal-based segmentation technique for single-cell resolved spatial transcriptomics. Computer vision methods, such as the Gaussian process, will be utilized to align serial 2D slices to reconstruct the 3D embryos. To marry both temporal and spatial data dimensions, we will augment our RNA velocity vector field model to encompass data-driven PDE (partial differential equations) models. Preliminary findings suggest our model can accurately simulate the entire C. elegans embryogenesis starting from a single zygote, accounting for protein expression, cell migration, and cell fate dynamics. In parallel, to harness existing vast datasets, we'll integrate our PDE-like model with the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (as used in ChatGPT). This integration will equip our foundational model to seamlessly manage spatial, temporal, and multi-omics data. Prioritizing interpretability and predictability, we will leverage differential geometry analysis as done in my previous Dynamo framework. By merging cutting-edge technology with computational innovation, this project seeks to bridge critical gaps in our understanding of embryogenesis, enabling a first-ever in silico model of mouse embryogenesis that has the potential to revolutionize the study of developmental biology, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic interventions.",1,1DP2HG014282-01,RFA-RM-23-005,NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE,11,8,2,0

Therefore, rejuvenating mitochondrial function or improving mitochondrial quality control might be an effective strategy to combat aging. Mitophagy is an essential mitochondrial quality control mechanism that mediates the lysosomal clearance of damaged mitochondria. Increasing lines of evidence have established the longevity-extending effects of enhanced mitophagy in various model organisms. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that augmented mitophagy may counteract agingassociated cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, identifying more efficient and specific agents that can modulate the clearance of defective mitochondria via mitophagy are likely to have significant therapeutic benefits. We conducted high-content image-based assays for mitophagy modulators using the pH-dependent fluorescent mitophagy reporter, mt-Keima. We identified the selective neddylation inhibitor, MLN4924, to be the most effective mitophagy activator. Neddylation is a posttranslational modification that attaches ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to protein targets via NEDD8-specific E1-E2-E3 enzymes. Of note, our mechanistic studies suggest MLN4924 effectively blocks neddylation of Cullin 2, a component of the elongins B/C-Cullin 2-Rbx1 (Ring-Box 1)-VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL2VHL). The inhibition leads to an accumulation of the Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 Subunit Alpha (HIF1α), a CRL2VHL substrate, and subsequent activation of the BCL2-interacting protein 3 (BCL2-interacting protein 3), a mitochondrial receptor for mitophagy induction. These results provide a novel connection between neddylation and mitophagy. This project aims to delineate the novel mechanistic link between mitophagy and neddylation, and to determine whether mitophagy represents a novel mechanism and therapeutic target for treating age-related cardiac dysfunction. These studies will be facilitated by our recently described mt-Keima mouse model to monitor in vivo cardiac mitophagy. Additionally, we will utilize a set of innovative reagents to genetically and pharmacologically modulate neddylation. To directly assess the role of neddylation in the heart, we have generated mice with the cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of NAE1, encoding a subunit of the E1 neddylation activating enzyme. In Aim 1 of the proposed studies, our goal is to determine the mechanisms by which inhibiting neddylation regulates mitophagy in cardiomyocytes and the heart. In Aim 2 of the proposed studies, we will genetically and pharmacologically manipulate neddylation in the adult heart using mouse models that lack NAE1 or are treated with MLN4924. We will determine whether restoring mitophagy via inhibiting neddylation ameliorates age-related cardiac dysfunction. Completing the proposed studies will produce critical insights into the role of mitophagy in age-related pathological conditions, and will fundamentally advance our understanding of the mechanisms of mitochondrial quality control in the heart.",5,5R01HL162909-03,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,7,0,0

Prostate cancer (Prostate cancer) is the 2nd most common cancer and the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in men worldwide, greatly impacting survival and quality of life in these patients. Androgen deprivation therapy (Androgen deprivation therapy) is the standard treatment for advanced and metastatic Prostate cancer. Unfortunately, Androgen deprivation therapy exacerbates sarcopenia contributing to the symptom burden and poor overall quality of life. Despite its relevance, there are no approved pharmacological treatments for sarcopenia. Several gaps in our knowledge impede the development of therapies for sarcopenia: 1) There is no agreement on the specific tools to assess clinically relevant outcomes, 2) The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, 3) the lived experiences of these men have not been ascertained, and 4) we are currently unable to predict who will develop sarcopenia upon starting Androgen deprivation therapy. The Overall Goals of this proposal are to establish clinical outcomes and predictors of sarcopenia in Prostate cancer patients undergoing Androgen deprivation therapy, and to characterize pathways and mechanisms leading to this phenotype, including the role of mitochondria. We propose to perform a clinical trial including 70 men with a diagnosis of Prostate cancer starting Androgen deprivation therapy. Participants will be followed for 12 months. Changes in body composition, muscle strength, physical performance, and patient reported outcomes (patient reported outcomes) including fatigue and quality of life will be measured, and their clinical relevance ascertained. Blood samples and muscle biopsies will be obtained at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months to investigate genes, proteins, and metabolites altered by Androgen deprivation therapy and to establish the predictive value of these biomarkers on clinical outcomes of sarcopenia using a comprehensive multi-omics approach. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Establish the clinical relevance of different outcome measures to assess sarcopenia in Prostate cancer patients starting Androgen deprivation therapy. We hypothesize that Androgen deprivation therapy will cause clinically meaningful decreases in appendicular lean body mass (appendicular lean body mass), muscle strength, physical performance and quality of life, 2) Identify and prioritize the molecular pathways mediating the effects of Androgen deprivation therapy on these outcomes using a multi-omics approach. Our hypothesis is that Androgen deprivation therapy will alter gene expression, protein and metabolite levels in muscle and plasma as measured by a comprehensive multi-omics approach, and this will be associated with sarcopenia, 3) Determine the role of baseline biomarker levels as predictors of sarcopenia; 4) Perform mechanistic studies in muscle tissue to define the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in Androgen deprivation therapy-induced sarcopenia. We anticipate that specific pathways probed in plasma and muscle, and impairments in mitochondrial function at baseline will predict the development of sarcopenia upon starting Androgen deprivation therapy. We will also characterize the experience of these men with regard to impact on quality of life. The data generated will provide essential knowledge on informative tools to measure clinically relevant outcomes in Androgen deprivation therapy-induced sarcopenia, and identify novel targets and clinically meaningful predictive biomarkers for this morbid condition.",1,1R01CA279220-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,3,4,2
10850674,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/ztFqGDzOgkCBQTZm_XxWAw/project-details/10850674#similar-Projects,The Role of Hippocampal area CA2 in Epilepsy,"A deeper understanding of the molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms that contribute to intractable epilepsy is of critical importance for improving existing therapeutic approaches. Rodent epilepsy models provide an important approach for achieving this goal and for the preclinical exploration of novel treatments. Here we focus on two types of mouse models relevant to drug-resistant seizure disorders in humans: the pilocarpine status epilepticus model (pilocarpine status epilepticus model) of acquired temporal lobe epilepsy (temporal lobe epilepsy) and a mouse model with a genetic variant in voltage-gated ion channels that cause seizure disorders in humans. temporal lobe epilepsy shows a characteristic pattern of hippocampal neurodegeneration termed mesial temporal sclerosis (mesial temporal sclerosis), with substantial loss of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 and CA3 regions and a relative sparing of dentate gyrus (dentate gyrus) and CA2 regions. Survival of dentate gyrus and CA2 has led to the hypotheses that both are important for seizure activity. Although the role of dentate gyrus has been well studied in rodent models, the role of CA2 has remained relatively unexplored. In the previous funding period, we found that pilocarpine status epilepticus model leads to increased overall CA2 excitation, due to increased intrinsic excitability, enhanced synaptic excitation from dentate gyrus and reduced synaptic inhibition. Importantly, we found that chronic chemogenetic or acute closed-loop optogenetic silencing of CA2 led to a significant decrease in seizure activity in pilocarpine status epilepticus model mice. However, our previous analyses were restricted to dorsal CA2. We will address here the role of ventral CA2, as studies in both humans and rodent models suggest that ventral hippocampus may be an even more important site for seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy than dorsal hippocampus. We will therefore investigate the hypothesis that chemogenetic and/or optogenetic silencing of ventral CA2 will be even more effective in reducing seizures than observed upon silencing dorsal CA2. Our previous studies also left open the question as to whether the increase in CA2 excitation in pilocarpine status epilepticus model is causally related to the role of CA2 in seizures. We will address this question by asking whether interventions that restore normal levels of CA2 intrinsic excitability can rescue seizures in pilocarpine status epilepticus model. Such experiments have the advantage over genetic-based silencing as they will not interfere with the normal role of CA2 in hippocampal-dependent social memory. In addition to acquired forms of epilepsy, an increasing number of cases of epilepsy have been shown to be caused by genetic variants, some associated with mesial temporal sclerosis and others without mesial temporal sclerosis. Here we address whether CA2 may play a more general role in seizure activity by investigating its role in a mouse model of a genetic form of epilepsy caused by mutations in the gene encoding the HCN1 voltage-gated ion channel, and testing whether CA2 silencing can suppress seizures in this model. The experiments of this proposal thus offer the promise of further validating CA2 as target for novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of a range of seizure disorders.",5,5R01NS106983-07,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,2,13,5,1

Pathogenic germline and somatic variants in the DNA repair gene BRCA1 are frequently detected in triple negative breast cancer (triple negative breast cancer) and BRCA1-mutated triple negative breast cancer can be targeted with polymerase inhibitors (PARPi (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPimerase inhibitors to achieve a clinical response. Elucidating the mechanism(s) by which BRCA1 and its associated partners resolve DNA lesions will provide new insights into how genome instability promotes cellular transformation and identify new therapeutic targets. In this proposal, we will investigate functions of the ATR-METTL3-BRCA1 axis in R-loop associated DNA damage to sustain stable genome. Persistent and unscheduled R-loops create structural barriers when they collide with collapsed replication forks or double strand breaks (double strand breaks) to elicit genome instability. Our preliminary data found that METTL3, a protein promoting RNA m6A modification when R-loops form during transcription, is recruited to repair DNA lesions at active transcription sites. METTL3 is phosphorylated by ATR, a key kinase in R-loop associated DNA damage signaling, and this phosphorylation promotes association with BRCA1. We found that BRCA1 is both necessary and sufficient for METTL3 recruitment to DNA damage sites. We identified several breast cancer associated METTL3 mutations and found that two catalytically inactive mutations impede HR repair by abolishing the association with BRCA1. Our proteomic analysis has identified a DNA/RNA helicase that resolves R-loops as the effector of the ATR-METTL3-BRCA1 axis. Furthermore, inhibition of METTL3 catalytic activity with a small molecule induces a defect in homologous recombination and enhances polymerase inhibitors (PARPi (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPimerase inhibitors sensitivity in triple negative breast cancer cell lines. We hypothesize that the ATR-METTL3-BRCA1 axis is critical for the R-loopassociated DNA damage repair and breast cancer development and offers a new therapeutic target for triple negative breast cancer. We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will elucidate mechanisms by which METTL3 Serine 43 phosphorylation promotes DNA/RNA helicase recruitment to resolve R-loop associated DNA damage. In Aim 2, we will determine the roles of the ATR-METTL3-BRCA1 axis in breast cancer development with mouse models. In Aim 3, we will target the ATR-METTL3-BRCA1 axis with a METTL3 inhibitor in triple negative breast cancer. Our studies will unravel a novel function for METTL3 in DNA repair and identify METTL3 as a promising therapeutic target in triple negative breast cancer.",1,1R01CA288736-01,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,10,10,2,4

For cells to live and replicate, they must be able to maintain and expand these membranes. In eukaryotes, the lipid building blocks of membranes are made mostly in the endoplasmic reticulum (endoplasmic reticulum) and then transported to other organelles from there. While the role of vesicle trafficking for lipid transfer between organelles has long been known, we have only in the last decade begun to appreciate the importance of non-vesicular protein-mediated lipid transfer at so-called membrane contact sites, where two organelles are closely apposed. Indeed, the endoplasmic reticulum, the main site of lipid synthesis, contacts every other cellular organelle at such sites. The main focus of the laboratory is to identify and characterize the protein residents of contact sites in order to better elucidate the still largely unknown lipid transfer processes that occur there, their molecular basis, and their role in physiology. Contact site residents include lipid ""shuttles"", proteins that equilibrate lipids between organelles, typically one lipid at a time, in order to fine-tune the lipid compositions of apposed contact site membranes. In addition, just in this last grant period, the PIs group was central to the discovery of elongated lipid transfer proteins in the VPS13 family that span between organelles and serve as bridges, with long hydrophobic grooves that solubilize lipid fatty acid moieties, allowing for bulk lipid flow across the aqueous space between membranes. Paradigm-shifting studies from the PI's group and collaborator suggest that these lipid transfer bridges work in partnership with integral membrane proteins, such as scramblases, to function in membrane expansion and organelle biogenesis, for example in the de novo formation of the autophagosome or the yeast prospore membrane. The role of protein-mediated lipid transfer in organelle biogenesis was unanticipated and previously thought to involve exclusively the fusion of hundreds of vesicles, as vesicles were until recently the only known mechanism for bulk lipid movement. The PI will continue the systematic characterization of contact site proteins and their physiological roles; emphasis going forward will be to dissect the mechanisms by which bridge-like lipid transporters collaborate with integral membrane proteins, including scramblases, to transfer lipids directionally from their site of synthesis to other organelles for membrane maintenance or de novo organelle formation.",2,2R35GM131715-06,PAR-22-180,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,7,2,0

This is important for decision making, which often involves evaluating information from one's surroundings to select appropriate choices. Corticostriatal circuits have been suggested to play critical roles in these decision processes, but their exact contributions remain unresolved. Our long-term goal is to understand how corticostriatal circuits contribute to flexible control of evidence evaluation and decision selection. Studies in rodents have identified the frontal orienting field (frontal orienting field) in the cortex and the anterior dorsal striatum (anterior dorsal striatum) to which it projects as playing important roles in evidence evaluation and decision selection. However, little is known about how this circuit controls the timescale of evidence evaluation that guides decision selection, which is important for any situation where evidence is acquired sequentially in time. Building on previous work, our overarching hypothesis is that the anterior dorsal striatum plays a role in controlling the period of influence of evidence on choices and that the frontal orienting field plays a role in decision selection that is guided by information routed via the anterior dorsal striatum. Here, we train rats to perform a novel change detection task that we have developed to address these questions. In Aim 1, we will identify contributions of the anterior dorsal striatum to control the timescales of evidence evaluation. We will use a combination of neural recordings and optogenetic perturbation to study neural representations and associated circuit mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will identify contributions of the frontal orienting field to free response decision selection with a parallel approach as Aim 1, again combining neural recordings and optogenetic perturbations. In Aim 3, we will measure the influence of the anterior dorsal striatum and frontal orienting field on each other with simultaneous neural recordings to inform mechanistic models of corticostriatal circuit contributions to evidence evaluation and decision selection. The approach we take is innovative because the lab has developed novel techniques, important refinements of cutting edge techniques, and extensions of established techniques to previously unexplored questions. The contribution of this work is significant because it will fill multiple major gaps in our knowledge about this critically important function and clinically relevant circuit. Furthermore, because corticostriatal circuits and the functions studied here are impacted by multiple brain disorders, an improved understanding of the connection between the two will be useful for developing new mental health treatments and avoiding side effects of treatments targeted to these brain circuits.",5,5R01MH124818-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,5,1

By 2030, people over 65 will account for over 20% of the population, and as many as 1 in 3 people will develop some form of dementia after their 65th birthday. However, society has yet to determine how to manage the burden of providing round-the-clock care for elderly people with memory impairment. Developing pharmacotherapies that prolong the period of independence of elderly people with the early stages of cognitive decline will have a significant impact. We have identified adropin, a small peptide that is abundant in the brain, as a potential lead for developing drugs that delay aging-related cognitive decline. Several lines of evidence suggest that low adropin activity in the brain predisposes to aging-related cognitive decline and that increasing adropin activity would be beneficial. In humans, low circulating adropin levels are predictive of cognitive decline in older adults. Moreover, in mouse studies, interventions that increase adropin levels have been shown to protect against aging-related cognitive decline. However, gaps in knowledge on how adropin acts at a cellular level are a barrier to developing drugs based on adropin. This proposal addresses this barrier by developing an antisense-oligonucleotide (antisense-oligonucleotide) therapy to boost expression of the endogenous gene. The central hypothesis tested by the proposal is that antisense-oligonucleotide which inhibit the interaction of the mRNA encoding adropin (ENHO) with miR-29, a microRNA that inhibits expression, will increase adropin levels in brain. Based on preclinical experiments using a transgenic mouse approach to prevent aging-related decline in adropin protein levels, antisense-oligonucleotide that specifically target the interaction of miR-29 with ENHO will increase adropin activity and significantly improve cognitive performance in aged mice. This exploratory proposal will identify 'lead' antisense-oligonucleotide sequences targeting the ENHO-miR-29 interaction using cell-based assays and perform preclinical experiments using old mice to demonstrate feasibility of the approach.",1,1R21AG087308-01,PAR-22-032,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,2,6,6,1

Defects in the nuclear pore complex (nuclear pore complex) and nucleocytoplasmic transport (nucleocytoplasmic transport) have been proposed to play a central role in ALS/FTD pathology. An outstanding knowledge gap is what are the mechanisms, consequences, and pathogenic relevance of impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport on neuronal resilience in neurodegenerative diseases and during aging. The objective of this application is to identify at the mechanistic level the novel cellular and molecular pathways that are dysfunctional and cause the failure of the nucleocytoplasmic transport ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. In particular, we will test the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton is a main modulator of nuclear stability and nuclear pore complex function, and that changes to this pathway in ALS/FTD lead to a diminished ability of neurons to cope with stress and physiological stimulation. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Define how actin regulates the function and dysfunction of the nuclear pore complex. We will perform a systematic and in-depth investigation of the molecular interactions between actin and the nuclear pore complex using pharmacological and genetic approaches in iPSC-derived neurons carrying the C9ORF72 mutation. 2) Identify the consequences of nucleocytoplasmic transport defects on the nuclear and cytoplasmic proteome in response to cellular stimulation. By combining an ""omics"" approach with a candidate approach (i.e. CREB pathway), we will analyze changes in the nuclear and cytoplasmic proteome in iPSC-derived neuronal models of ALS/FTD following stimulations, and we will test the potentials of cytoskeleton modulation to rescue such defects. 3) Define how defects in nuclear import affect the transcriptional response to cellular stimulation. We will analyze changes in gene expression and splicing profile in ALS/FTD neurons following cell stimulation by RNA-Seq. Network analysis performed by integrating the results from the transcriptomic and proteomics approaches will identify ALS/FTD relevant altered pathways. Modulation of the cytoskeleton will be used to rescue the identified defects. At the completion of this research, we will have identified the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control the stability and function of the nuclear pore complex, and the functional consequences that the disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport has on the resilience of neurons in ALS/FTD. Gaining insights on what pathways upstream and downstream of the nuclear pore complex are affected in ALS/FTD will greatly expand our understanding of disease pathogenesis and will allow us to identify yet unexplored avenues for therapy in these diseases. Ultimately, we expect that our research will lead to more effective therapeutic strategies that take advantage of the crosstalk between nuclear pore complex, RNA regulation, and cytoskeleton.

Our published work and new preliminary data highlight two checkpoints that restrain harmful B cell and antibody responses to the placenta. Checkpoint 1 involves how antigen interacts with B cells. Placental antigen is modified with sialic acid sugar-carrying glycans (sialoglycans) and activation of placental-specific B cells is suppressed in a mechanism that is at least partially dependent upon recognition of sialoglycans by inhibitory receptors on the B cell surface. Checkpoint 2 is a failsafe mechanism that protects the conceptus from antibody-mediated attack. This ""effector phase"" checkpoint is illustrated by our observation that pregnancy remains unaffected even when high titers of anti-placental antibodies, experimentally introduced before mating, are present. Notably, both checkpoints are specific to placental antigen itself. Checkpoint 1 appears to be driven by immunosuppressive sialoglycans that coat placental antigen. For Checkpoint 2, our data and the literature support the hypothesis that anti-placental antibodies become modified with suppressive glycans that diminish their function. Because the checkpoints are placental antigen-specific, maternal B cell responses to foreign antigen remain intact. Our data show that to foreign antigen, pregnant mice generate B cell and antibody responses commensurate with non-pregnant mice. However, to our surprise, humoral responses during pregnancy occur seemingly independent of robust follicular helper T cells (Tfh). Since humoral immunity in non-pregnant hosts is well documented to be regulated by Tfh, discovery of a Tfh-independent mechanism that enhances humoral immunity during pregnancy is warranted. We propose to study B cell and antibody responses to placental versus foreign antigen. Project hypothesis: Sialoglycan modification of placental antigen, suppressed effector capacity of antiplacental antibodies, and alteration in Tfh-B cell dynamics lead to protection of the conceptus while preserving immunity to foreign antigen. We submit this application in response to RFA-AI-23-027. Aim 1. Define mechanisms of placental antigen-specific B cell suppression (Checkpoint 1). Aim 2. Characterize the nonpathogenic nature of anti-placental antibodies (Checkpoint 2). Aim 3. Evaluate maternal B cell and follicular helper T cell dynamics in response to foreign antigen. Identifying molecular mechanisms suppressing B cell activation (Aim 1) and mapping out tolerance pathways that protect the conceptus from antibody-mediated damage (Aim 2) are the first steps in evaluating how alterations affect pregnancy outcomes. Identification of a pregnancy factor capable of boosting humoral immunity (Aim 3) would be a significant divergence from the textbook paradigm and could become clinically useful to boost responses to vaccines and fight infections.",1,1R01AI184571-01,RFA-AI-23-027,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,3,4,1,2

Cell-to-cell heterogeneities exist within tissues, and understanding the nature of these differences in terms of metabolite profile has vast implications regardless the type of disease. Beautiful experiments using fluorescent sensors have been developed to quantify small molecule metabolites within cells; however, the act of shining light on a cell has been shown to have deleterious effects. Further, these sensors are not easily generalizable. We endeavor to make the most accurate measurements of cellular metabolites with minimal perturbation to cellular homeostasis using nanoelectrochemical measurements. These measurements have the potential to open the door to unrealized sensitivity in sub-cellular metabolite quantification. Electrochemistry at nanoelectrodes has been used to interrogate cellular processes and quantify reactive species within cells. However, the time it takes for a nanoelectrode to deliver enough charge to convert a cell's contents during amperometric and voltammetric experiments is on the order of 100 ms. Therefore, novel techniques must be developed to minimize the perturbation to cellular homeostasis to ensure accurate measurements of natural cellular processes. Our group has recently investigated open circuit potentiometry, which was chosen because the measurement is carried out with negligible current. We have discovered that this technique is independent of electrode size. This finding indicates the sensitivity of the measurement will not change with time appreciably, and longitudinal experiments within single cells can be carried out. We propose to develop metabolite-specific nanoelectrodes that operate under open circuit conditions. We will draw from our experience fabricating nanoelectrodes and studying oxygen content within single cells and experience developing sensors to create a generalized platform for single cell metabolomics measurements. Specificity is gained via oxidoreductase enzymes that are trapped on top of an electrode surface by a hydrogel. Metabolite concentration is obtained by the enzymatic turnover rate, which is dependent on substrate concentration.

Unhealthful exposures including obesity, inactivity and a high fat diet can lead to a loss of CD8+ T cell effector function and tumor progression in preclinical breast tumor models, while healthful exposures, such as voluntary wheel running, can offset tumor growth and dysregulated conditions in the tumor immune microenvironment leading to increased trafficking and enhanced function of CD8+ T cells. Although emerging pre-clinical evidence is compelling, several gaps in epidemiological knowledge regarding the link among lifestyle factors, tumor immunity and BC outcomes remain. First, despite a suggestion to adhere to The American Institute for Cancer Research (American Institute for Cancer Research) and The American Cancer Society (American Cancer Society) cancer prevention lifestyle guidelines after a cancer diagnosis, which lifestyle factors and whether they work together to impact BC outcomes has not been well established. Second, research on the role of lifestyles and immunity in BC patients has primarily focused on immune cell subsets in the circulating peripheral blood. To our knowledge, whether lifestyles are associated with distinct immune cell phenotypes in the breast tumor immune microenvironment, the site most relevant for treatment response and BC prognosis, has remained uninvestigated. Building off the extant preclinical evidence and multiple lines of published and preliminary evidence from our group, we designed the current study to address these critical gaps in knowledge. Leveraging data from 1160 primary invasive BC patients enrolled in the Data Bank and BioRepository (Data Bank and BioRepository) at Roswell Park, we developed a composite lifestyle index score (lifestyle index score) reflecting adherence to seven cancer prevention recommendations from The American Institute for Cancer Research and The American Cancer Society including: 1) maintaining a healthy weight; 2) being physically active; 3) eating a variety of fruits and vegetables; 4) limiting red and processed meats; 5) limiting or avoiding sugar-sweetened beverages; 6) limiting or avoiding alcohol consumption; and 7) avoiding smoking. Our preliminary analyses reveals that patients with the highest versus lowest lifestyle index score (e.g., tertiles) experience striking survival advantages. Based on these and other preliminary data, we formulated our central hypothesis that CD8+ T cell composition in the breast tumor immune microenvironment mediates the observed association between the lifestyle index score and BC outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will link detailed lifestyle data with multispectral immunohistochemical immune profiling from 1160 BC patients enrolled in Data Bank and BioRepository with available FFPE tumor tissue to execute formal mediation pathway analyses via three Specific Aims. In aim 1, we will define associations of the lifestyle index score with CD8+ T cell composition in the breast tumor immune microenvironment (cell densities, ratios and clusters of total CD8+ T cells, exhausted CD8+ T cells and activated CD8+ T cells). Next, in aim 2, we will identify associations of CD8+ T cell composition in the breast tumor immune microenvironment with BC outcomes. In aim 3, we will delineate the contributions of CD8+ T cells in the tumor immune microenvironment as biological intermediaries underlying the observed association between the lifestyle index score and BC outcomes.",1,1R03CA289559-01,PAR-23-058,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

The activity of these neurons is modulated by changes in CO2 (or its proxy, H+) and various other sensory and arousal-state inputs to control breathing; their dysfunction is implicated in various central disorders of breathing (e.g., sudden infant death, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (congenital central hypoventilation syndrome)). The molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in CO2/H+ sensing by retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons, and how those are established developmentally and adapted to pathological conditions, remain matters of continuing scrutiny. In two Aims, we address a receptor-mediated mechanism of pH sensitivity, and explore gene expression patterns that support developmental and adaptive retrotrapezoid nucleus function. In Aim 1, we use new mouse genetic models to identify mechanisms of pH sensitivity in retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons that are mediated by proton-activated GPR4 modulation of a background K+ channel, exploring the hypothesis that GPR4 is expressed in retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons, where its intrinsic pH sensitivity leads to inhibition of KNa1.1 (encoded by Kcnt1) to contribute to CO2 stimulation of breathing and arousal. We propose to: [1.1] Test whether direct detection of protons by GPR4 accounts for its effects on retrotrapezoid nucleus neuronal sensitivity and CO2-stimulated breathing; [1.2] Test whether KNa1.1 (Slo2.2, Kcnt1) is a GPR4-inhibited K+ channel effector in retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons; and [1.3] Define sites of GPR4 protein expression. In Aim 2, we combine single cell RNA-Seq with gene manipulation and developmental/physiological challenges to test the hypothesis that Phox2b expression dictates a distinct molecular signature that supports critical physiological functions of retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons, and that those gene expression patterns are malleable to developmental and physiological challenges in support of breathing. We propose to: [2.1] Determine consequences of Phox2b depletion on the retrotrapezoid nucleus neuron transcriptome; [2.2] Determine effect of birth on retrotrapezoid nucleus neuron transcriptome; and [2.3] Characterize developmental and adaptive gene regulation in retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons. To accomplish these aims, we employ a variety of techniques at multiple levels of analysis. Specifically, we combine genetic and viral approaches for retrotrapezoid nucleus neuron-specific manipulation of gene expression; perform electrophysiological and functional/behavioral studies at the cellular and organismal levels; and utilize molecular neuroanatomy and single neuron genetic analyses for phenotypic characterization and quantification of normal and adaptive gene expression profiles. Collectively, the proposed studies will provide novel information regarding molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate the pH-dependent activity of retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons, at critical periods during development and in response to physiological challenge, with relevance for identifying new therapeutic targets for disorders of breathing.",5,5R01HL108609-12,PA-19-056,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",0,1,5,1

The development of cortical fields and their connections is highly dependent on the incoming sensory inputs they receive from the various sensory organs, such as the eyes and the skin. This input, together with the unique combinations of sensory information available in the environment shapes the neocortex to generate optimal behavior. We know from previous studies in our own laboratory that very early loss of input from the eyes leads to massive changes in the brain, such that all of what would normally be the primary visual cortex (V1) contains neurons that respond to somatosensory and auditory stimulation. This reorganized V1 receives ectopic input from thalamic nuclei and cortical fields associated with somatosensory and auditory processing. The current proposal addresses several fundamental questions raised by these previous findings: 1) How does the age of onset of blindness differentially impact cortical connectivity? 2) What are single-neuron response properties in reorganized V1 and S1, and does age of blindness onset impact these properties? 3) What is the relationship between functional and anatomical changes in V1 and S1 and compensatory behaviors mediated by the spared sensory systems? Our animal model, the short-tailed opossum, is highly altricial at birth (equivalent to embryonic day 11 in the mouse), allowing ex utero manipulations to the nervous system at developmental time points that would be in utero in other mammals. In these experiments, bilateral enucleations will be made at specific developmental milestones: 1) Prior to the onset of spontaneous activity in the retina, before retinal ganglion cells have reached their subcortical targets, and before thalamocortical axons have innervated the neocortex; 2) When spontaneous activity in the retina is present and retinogeniculate and thalamocortical axons have innervated their targets; 3) Just after eye opening, when sensory driven activity in the retina is present and thalamocortical and corticocortical connections have formed. Following enucleations, animals will be assessed at several different time points. These studies are novel in scope in that they interrogate how the of age of vision loss affects the reorganization of brain circuits and behavior, and if functional and anatomical changes to the neocortex are linked to compensatory behavior. These data can direct therapeutic interventions (e.g. tactile training based behavior), and even allow predictions for behavioral outcomes following retinal implants or gene targeted therapies performed at different ages.",5,5R01EY034303-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE,0,1,5,1

Recent estimates show 250 million children less than five years of age are not reaching their developmental potential, and 151 million have stunted growth.1,2 Determinants of stunted growth and development are multi-factorial, including interactions between biological, behavioral, social, and environmental conditions, yet the evidence-base is minimal for integrated approaches to tackle the interwoven factors. Our group recently found significant impacts from an egg intervention on young child growth and biomarkers of nutrition and brain development. The effects on important psychosocial indictors of child development, however, were not assessed. Building on these findings and those of our pilot study of a group-based, multicomponent intervention (Grandi Byen, Haitian Creole for ""grow well""), we propose a larger RCT to examine a greater breadth of egg intervention outcomes, the synergistic effects of adding psychoeducational parenting to the egg intervention, and mediating biological, behavioral and social factors. The 3-arm longitudinal RCT, to be carried out in Cap-Haitien, Haiti, where our group has nine years of research experience, established partnerships, and a strong research infrastructure. It is representative of resource-poor urban contexts globally, where parents face common economic and environmental challenges to child growth and development. The trial will compare the following groups for effectiveness in reducing young child stunted growth and enhancing overall development: 1) multicomponent Grandi Byen intervention (responsive parenting, nutrition, hygiene + one egg per day for 6 months); 2) nutrition intervention (one egg per day for 6 months); and 3) standard well-baby care. Infants will be enrolled between 6-8 months of age and followed longitudinally for one year. The specific aims are: Aim 1 (primary): To demonstrate the reproducibility and feasibility of egg-based interventions in reducing childhood stunting, and test its impact on development. Hypothesis 1: Linear growth will be increased by 0.30 LAZ in children receiving one egg per day compared to standard care. Hypothesis 2: Children receiving the egg intervention will have better cognitive, motor and language development compared to standard care. Question 1 (exploratory): Does an egg-based intervention impact social-emotional development? Aim 2 (primary): To investigate the incremental benefit of Grandi Byen compared to egg only and standard care groups on primary outcomes of child growth and development. Hypothesis 3: Children of mothers receiving Grandi Byen will increase linear growth by 0.10 LAZ compared to the egg intervention. Hypothesis 4: Children of mothers receiving Grandi Byen will have higher scores on child cognition, language, motor, and socio-emotional development, with an effect size of 0.36 on cognition, compared to standard care. An economic evaluation will be conducted to compare the efficiency of the interventions. Aim 3 (secondary). To explore pathways of intervention impacts on child growth and development by delineating the additive and synergistic effects of biological (nutrient biomarkers, bone age, and enteric disease), psychosocial (responsive parenting, cognitive stimulation), and environmental (hygiene and sanitation, diet) factors. This study expands upon this earlier work by bringing together a transdisciplinary team spanning the biological and social sciences to work in partnership with Haitian collaborators. We will merge methods and concepts to produce comprehensive perspectives on several high priority areas including social, economic and biological factors that impact child brain development and function, nutrition among infants and very young children, determinants of bone health; and traumatic stress associated with growing up in abject poverty.",5,5R01HD098255-05,PA-18-480,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,1,5,3,2

These mutations explicitly trigger photoreceptor death via a common mechanism - by abnormally elevating cyclic GMP production in the dark. Although the biochemical origin of the dominant GUCY2D and GUCA1A retinopathies became better understood over the past decade, potential approaches to their therapy, such as using gene editing or RNA interference to suppress particular alleles causing the disease, continue to present a major conceptual challenge. This proposal, conforming to the NEI mission to support research with respect to blinding eye diseases, visual disorders and mechanisms of visual function, explores the foundation of a new approach for the prospective therapy - targeting the common biochemical pathway underlying GUCY2D and GUCA1A dominant retinopathies. The proposal is built on the following main findings: (i) understanding that deregulation of retinal guanylyl cyclase 1 activity is the key to the photoreceptor death caused by the gain-of-function mutations in GUCY2D and GUCA1A; (ii) development of mouse genetic models for studying the biochemical and physiological mechanisms of degeneration incited by the mutant retinal guanylyl cyclase 1 and guanylyl cyclase activating protein 1; (iii) recent findings that the abnormal increase in cGMP production that leads to photoreceptor death can be effectively opposed by three different biochemical processes, such as acceleration of cGMP decay in the dark by recombinant phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5r), stemming retinal guanylyl cyclase 1 activation by guanylyl cyclase activating protein 1 using a newly designed protein inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase (protein inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase), and enhancing protection of photoreceptors against the presence of deregulated retinal guanylyl cyclase 1 using retinal degeneration-3 (retinal degeneration-3) protein. The research plan of this proposal pursues three Specific Aims, each addressing a new original concept designed to avert photoreceptor dystrophy caused by deregulation of retinal guanylyl cyclase 1. Specific Aim 1 explores the biochemical and physiological mechanisms underlying rescue of photoreceptors in mouse models harboring the degenerative mutants of retinal guanylyl cyclase 1 and guanylyl cyclase activating protein 1 using ectopic expression of PDE5r. Aim 2 explores mechanisms of their rescue using protein inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase. Aim 3 explores the mechanisms supporting the survival of photoreceptors using retinal degeneration-3. We reason that achieving these Specific Aims will help in developing approaches to the future therapy of the dominant GUCY2D and GUCA1A retinopathies.",5,5R01EY034861-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE,18,13,9,1

Although integrating genome-wide association studies with functional genomics datasets, like the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (Genotype-Tissue Expression Project) and The Cancer Genomic Atlas (The Cancer Genomic Atlas), has yielded promising results in identifying candidate target genes for many traits1-3, these approaches overlook the complexity of alternative splicing and isoform diversity within the transcriptome. Indeed, recent studies of long read RNA-sequencinguencing (RNA-sequencing) data across tissues reveal that as much as 4060% of the human transcriptome is unannotated6-8 due to overlooked isoforms. We propose to re-align existing breast-specific short-read RNA-sequencing datasets using novel isoform annotations developed from long-read RNAseq data. We will then integrate these with existing breast cancer and mammographic density genome-wide association studies data to identify isoformand splice-site-specific mechanisms underlying genetic associations for breast cancer and mammographic density phenotypes. We will build on our recent work where we developed and showcased the promise of isoform-level transcriptome-wide association studies (isoform-level transcriptome-wide association studies), an innovative machine learning framework that integrates genetics, all expressed isoforms of a gene, and phenotypic associations. Specifically, we will first quantify isoform expression and alternative splicing events in Genotype-Tissue Expression Project and The Cancer Genomic Atlas using novel transcript assemblies from long-read RNA-sequencing datasets (Aim 1). We will benchmark multiple statistical approaches for alignment of isoforms by conducting extensive evaluation studies. We will then leverage these newly aligned isoforms and alternative splicing events in breast tissue to pinpoint isoforms and alternative splicing events likely to mediate germline genetic associations with breast cancer risk and mammographic density phenotypes (Aim 2). This innovative proposal aligns with the NCI strategic objective of Understanding the Mechanisms of Cancer and Detecting and Diagnosing Cancer and addresses a critical challenge in studying the genetic etiology of breast cancer: prioritizing potential causal biological mechanisms for further follow-up. Our proposal is unique in that it will re-quantify and integrate multi-tissue, multi-level transcriptomic reference panels (both shortand long-read RNA-sequencing) with robust genome-wide association studies summary statistics using cutting-edge computational tools for transcriptomics and a novel integrative framework. By combining publicly available multilevel `omic datasets in a systemic genomic epidemiology framework, our work will provide both molecular data resources and reproducible computational frameworks that can be easily expanded to other tissues and traits. Specifically, we will develop open-source computational pipelines for developing tissue-specific, novel isoform annotations for short-read RNA-sequencing alignment and expression quantification and create and maintain a publicly available portal to host isoand splice-QTL summary statistics and predictive models allowing for the broader research community to explore similar investigations across traits and tissues.",1,1R21CA293419-01,PAR-23-255,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,11,8,2,0

Adult cardiac muscle is thought to lack the ability to repair and regenerate after myocardial infarction. Additionally, the death of cardiomyocytes stemming from myocardial infarction activates an irreversible cascade of events leading to heart failure. Stem cell technologies, biomaterials, and various bioengineering approaches have been used to develop functional human-engineered tissue, which ultimately can serve to revolutionize the treatment of the damaged heart. The heart is a complicated, multicellular tissue with hierarchical, structural, and multifunctional characteristics. As such, this tissue presents a huge challenge to replicate through traditional tissue engineering approaches. Based on an anatomical and physiological understanding of cardiac tissue, one crucial challenge in cardiac tissue engineering is replicating the complex architecture (anisotropic myocardial fibers and geometric vasculature) within a cardiac tissue construct and improving its functional maturation. Thus, the objective of this project is to develop a novel advanced dual 3D bioprinting platform and multiple biomechanical stimulation strategies for engineering a novel thick, functional myocardial tissue with anisotropic myocardial fibers and geometric vasculature. Three specific aims of this project are:  to fabricate anisotropic myocardial constructs with geometric vasculature via dual 3D bioprinting,  to conduct a systemic investigation of hemodynamic behaviors and cell responses for the vascularized myocardial construct under rhythmic mechanical stimulation, and  to perform a functional evaluation with an in vivo pig myocardial infarction model. We expect that innovatively integrating a dual 3D bioprinting platform with biomechanical stimulation will create a functional cardiac tissue with myocardial beating and mature microcirculation for myocardial infarction treatment. If successful, it will contribute to the prevention of post-infarction ventricular remodeling and the restoration of normal cardiac function. Furthermore, it will not only help patients who are suffering from extensive physical and emotional pain to fight and win the battle against heart failure, but will revolutionize current bioengineering research, leading to a long-term solution for advanced clinical therapeutics.",1,1R01HL171317-01,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,2,0,0

The reasons for this poor efficacy likely stem from an incomplete understanding of the immunological and microbial interactions that lead to disease. Recent studies examining immune interactions in human inflammatory bowel disease patients have highlighted dysregulated interactions between immunoregulatory and inflammatory T cells as a key feature of disease. However, the exact cellular players involved and how these dysregulated interactions occur remain unclear. In efforts to close these gaps in knowledge, our long-term goals are to define the mechanisms that govern the interactions between immunoregulatory and inflammatory T cells and how these interactions can be targeted to improve inflammatory bowel disease therapeutics. In our preliminary data, we show that mice carrying conventional T cell (i.e. αβ T cell receptor+)-specific deletions of STAT3 and BATF develop an aggressive spontaneous colitis that closely resembles intestinal inflammation that is characteristic of human inflammatory bowel disease. Intriguingly, the known mediators and suppressors of disease (IL-17-producing Th17 and Foxp3+ T regulatory (regulatory) cells), are equivalent in STAT3/BATF-double deficient mice and disease-free STAT3 and BATF-single deficient mice. These data suggest that a STAT3/BATFregulated transcriptional program induces Th17/regulatory-independent immunoregulatory function that is critical for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Intestinal disease in conventional T cell STAT3/BATF-deficient mice was marked by the rapid accumulation of microbiota-dependent inflammatory γδ T cells, resembling those found in lesional colonic tissues of inflammatory bowel disease patients. These data suggest that STAT3/BATF-expressing conventional T cells interact with the microbiota and γδ T cells to suppress disease. The objective of this study is to determine how STAT3 and BATF regulate the interactions and functions of conventional immunoregulatory T cells and to define how microbiota-dependent γδ T cells contribute to disease. Here we hypothesize that conventional T cell STAT3 and BATF cooperatively regulate a gene network that influences interactions with the microbiota and pathogenic γδ T cell responses in inflammatory bowel disease. We will test this hypothesis via two aims in which we will 1) define the STAT3/BATF-regulated transcriptional network that governs conventional-γδ T cell interactions in inflammatory bowel disease and 2) determine the role the microbiota-induced γδ T cells in driving inflammatory bowel disease. The results of this work will be highly significant and innovative as we have identified a novel mechanism by which conventional T cells maintain intestinal homeostasis and developed a new murine model to examine interactions of these cells with the microbiota and γδ T cells in disease. Further, our studies will provide insight into new therapies that may act to bolster STAT3/BATF+ conventional T cells to prevent the onset of inflammatory bowel disease.",5,5R21AI176326-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,3,4,1,3

The functional enzyme is required for the breakdown of glycoproteins in the cellular lysosomes. Absence of enzymatic activity results in impaired lysosomal function and accumulation of aspartylglucosamine (GlcNAc-Asn) in the lysosomes of various tissues and body fluids. The key consequence of the substrate accumulation is lysosomal hypertrophy that manifests as intellectual disability, and other associated symptoms including skeletal and joint abnormalities. Patients have slowed/regressive psychomotor development throughout childhood, deteriorating around the third decade of life to become severely impaired mentally and physically, highly dependent on supportive care thereafter. The median lifespan of AGU patients is approximately 40-50 years. Through efforts primarily funded through a parent-organized non-profit foundation, the Rare Trait Hope Fund, Dr. Gray's lab has generated preclinical data supporting the initiation of a Phase I/II gene therapy trial to treat AGU. A Type B preIND meeting was held with the FDA regarding this in January 2018, which has charted a clear path forward for human translation. This approach would use an AAV9/AGA vector injected intrathecally, following a precedent set by Dr. Gray's previous efforts to initiate similar Phase I trials for Giant Axonal Neuropathy at the NIH Clinical Center in 2015 and for CLN7 Batten disease at Children's Medical Center Dallas in 2021. The wealth of available disease-specific biomarkers for AGU (including localized imaging of the AGA enzyme substrate in discrete brain regions) along with a potentially large treatment window, make AGU an ideal disease to rapidly and fully assess the complete efficacy and/or shortcomings of intrathecal AAV9 as a ""platform"" approach to treat many other neurological diseases.

This project is directed at validating inhibition of telomerase reverse transcriptase (telomerase reverse transcriptase) as a means to enhance the therapeutic index of radiation and achieving key progress toward translating this strategy to the clinic. While telomerase reverse transcriptase is not expressed in most normal cells, approximately 90% of cancers display reactivation of telomerase reverse transcriptase expression, supporting the catalytic activity of telomerase to maintain telomere integrity despite deregulated growth. While drugs targeting telomerase reverse transcriptase have displayed sufficient safety in patients to evaluate effects of blocking telomere repeat synthesis, this has failed in solid tumors, as telomere erosion is too slow to affect tumor progression. Beyond its essential role in cancer cell immortality, telomerase reverse transcriptase also contributes to pathways that support multiple cancer hallmarks. By limiting oxidative stress, accelerating double strand break repair and supporting cell survival, telomerase reverse transcriptase expression in cancer cells may confer clinically significant resistance to radiation. This raises the question whether transiently targeting telomerase reverse transcriptase during radiotherapy to enhance the toxicity of the resulting DNA damage to the cancer cells might significantly improve the therapeutic index of radiation. In recently published work, our groups described a novel class of telomerase reverse transcriptase inhibitors inspired by the antibiotic chrolactomycin. Like the natural product, our streamlined natural product analogs react with an active site cysteine in the telomerase reverse transcriptase reverse transcriptase active site. The optimized inhibitor, NU-1, is otherwise nontoxic in vitro or in vivo, but inhibits telomerase activity at low micromolar concentrations. NU-1 confers sensitivity to radiation to telomerase reverse transcriptase-expressing cancer cells. Our data suggest that telomerase reverse transcriptase may promote non-homologous endjoining repair, thereby affecting repair pathway choice. Finally, using a syngeneic tumor model in BALB/c mice, we have demonstrated marked sensitization to radiation in vivo, apparently mediated by persistent DNA damage and increased anti-tumor immune response. With these preliminary studies in hand, we propose to 1) Dissect the roles of telomerase reverse transcriptase in double strand break repair and immune evasion, and 2) Improve the drug-like properties of NU-1 and use these novel compounds to understand how best to obtain radiation sensitization and an effective anti-tumor immune response.",5,5R01CA282781-02,PAR-22-198,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,10,10,2,4

These genes are epigenetically marked and exhibit parental-specific expression. Imprinting plays a role in the transmission of a number of human disorders, including Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (SRS (Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (SRS), Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS (Silver-Russell Syndrome (SRS), PraderWilli Syndrome (SRS and Angelman Syndrome (SRS, in that the sex of the parent that transmits the affected gene(s) determines whether offspring will be affected. Aberrant imprinted gene expression is also involved in the onset or progression of cancers, such as Wilms tumors. The overall goal of our work is to elucidate the mechanism by which parental identity of imprinted genes is established and maintained. The in-depth study of imprinted genes can additionally inform our understanding of genome regulation and nuclear architecture as imprinted genes are located in large domains and are often regulated by long non-coding RNAs, CTCF-dependent insulators, and allele-specific epigenetic modifications. These studies will employ the H19/Igf2 and Grb10/Ddc1a imprinted domains, both of which harbor CTCF-binding imprinting control regions (imprinting control regions), which regulate imprinting. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the role of the H19/Igf2 ICR in allelic DNA methylation acquisition and the maintenance of imprinting. We will engineer mice with humanized imprinting control regions and human iPSCs that have common Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (SRS deletions and study the mechanism by which these deletions contribute to DNA methylation defects and loss of imprinting. Additionally, because mice inheriting the full-length humanized ICR paternally fail to establish and maintain DNA methylation, we will assess the cause of this male germlinespecific DNA methylation failure, providing insight into how paternally-methylated imprinting control regions are epigenetically modified in the male germline. In Specific Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanism of imprinting at the Grb10/Ddc1a imprinted locus. These genes exhibit tissue-specific imprinting; Grb10 is expressed from the maternal allele in somatic cells and switches to the paternal allele in neurons while the Ddc1a isoform is expressed from the paternal allele in heart. To determine the role of CTCF in alleleand tissue-specific expression, we will generate CTCF binding site deletions in the ICR in mice and examine the consequences of these mutations on imprinting of Grb10 and Ddc1a. We have also identified a new tissue and allele-specific CTCF-binding element that is developmentally regulated and critical to Grb10/Ddc1a imprinting, which we propose to function as an insulator. We will investigate this newly described insulator through deletion of a putative mesoderm-specific enhancer.

Therapeutic strategies to restore salivary glands function include gene therapy, stem cell transplantation and various bioengineering approaches; however, they are dependent on the presence of residual functional salivary glands tissue, a condition not met with full radiation treatment due to extensive fibrotic coverage of the salivary glands. Although a role for Lysyl Oxidase (Lysyl Oxidase) in radiation-induced fibrosis has not been investigated in salivary glands, it is notable that each Lysyl Oxidase family member has been implicated in various fibrotic disorders affecting a wide range of organs. This has prompted efforts to develop monoclonal antibodies targeting specific Lysyl Oxidase enzymes; however, recent Phase II clinical trials of a monoclonal antibody against Lysyl Oxidase-Like (Lysyl OxidaseL2) failed to show efficacy against primary sclerosing cholangitis. These findings underscore the importance of considering functional redundancy when targeting individual Lysyl Oxidase and since the catalytic site of all Lysyl Oxidase family members possesses a conserved binding site for copper (Cu), focusing on inhibition of Cu delivery to these enzymes is a novel antifibrotic strategy. Preliminary studies have identified a novel compound, MKV3, as a potent inhibitor of the ATP7A copper transporter. Furthermore, ATP7A trafficking to the plasma membrane enhances Lysyl Oxidase activity in cancer cells which is blocked by MKV3. Ionizing radiation was found to stimulate Cu-dependent ATP7A trafficking in rat parotid Par-C10 cells and that copper modulators, such as tetrathiomolybdate (tetrathiomolybdate) and MKV3, block this process. To extend these findings to in vivo studies, preliminary results indicate that radiation treatment not only triggers Cu-dependent ATP7A trafficking in mouse submandibular glands (submandibular glands) from the perinuclear region to the plasma membrane but also causes collagen deposition of extracellular matrix, with these events being reduced by tetrathiomolybdate. Finally, ATP7A localization was found to be altered in the fibrotic submandibular glands of irradiated patients, thus indicating a likelihood for clinical applications of these findings. Based on the above, it is hypothesized that ionizing radiation triggers Cu-stimulated ATP7A trafficking in salivary glands, which facilitates the metalation of Lysyl Oxidase enzymes leading to increasing collagen crosslinking and fibrosis. Therefore, the following Aims are proposed: Aim 1 will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of altered Cu homeostasis in irradiated salivary glands. Aim 2 will evaluate the therapeutic potential of submandibular glands-specific Atp7a gene silencing on radiation-induced fibrosis and saliva secretion. Aim 3 will evaluate the therapeutic effects of pharmacological targeting of copper transport on radiation-induced submandibular glands fibrosis. Together, these studies will demonstrate that targeting of Cu metabolism can be used as a novel treatment for radiation-induced salivary glands fibrosis.",1,1R01DE034293-01,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH,17,0,4,0

One of the major reasons for this limitation is the general lack of animal models and framework for studying the neural substrates of social behavior whereby two or more individuals interact in real-time and in a way that is amenable to neuronal analysis or perturbation techniques. This limited understanding impacts not only wide spanning fields of study such as ecology, neurology and psychology but also our ability to treat conditions such as autism-spectrum disorder in which social behavior is prominently affected. Primates are highly social animals that share many behaviors in common with humans and can serve as a potential model for understanding the basic elements that underlie interactive behavior. In this proposal, we aim to build on our team's unique combined experience with jointly interacting primate pairs and groups, social theory, multi-site neuronal recordings and time-resolved neuromodulation techniques to begin identifying some of the basic neuronal encoding components of interactive behaviors, their representation within and across cortical populations, and their dynamic across short and long temporal scales. Using social group theory in primates together with population modeling and perturbation techniques, we will investigate core social constructs such as agency identity, group dynamics and decision strategies essential for effective social behavior. We will also test specific hypotheses on the causal contribution that distinct frontal, temporal and parietal areas play in social interaction and what exact aspects are involved. Taken together, this proposal aims to provide a formal theorybased model by which to begin investigating interactive social behavior at the single-neuronal, population and circuit-based levels. We believe that this is an essential new line of investigation and has the potential to open up a poorly explored but important field within neuroscience and from which to begin testing neuro-modulatory interventions aimed at treating psychosocial disorders.",5,5R01MH131664-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,5,1

Viral RNA expressing (Viral RNA expressing) cells are detected at low frequencies in secondary lymphoid tissues (secondary lymphoid tissues) of people with HIV (people with HIV) on antiretroviral therapy, constitute the major HIV RNA reservoir in the human body, and are likely the principal source of rebound viremia when antiretroviral therapy is stopped. Little is known about the microenvironment of Viral RNA expressing cells in secondary lymphoid tissues of people with HIV during antiretroviral therapy. In lymph nodes and spleen from people with HIV on prolonged antiretroviral therapy the majority of Viral RNA expressing cells reside outside of B cell follicles and only a minority are TFH. We observed that Viral RNA expressing cells are preferentially located adjacent to B cells not only in follicular, but also in extrafollicular regions (extrafollicular regions) of secondary lymphoid tissues in people with HIV and SIV-infected rhesus macaques on antiretroviral therapy; frequencies of B cells in extrafollicular regions of secondary lymphoid tissues correlate with frequencies of Viral RNA expressing cells. In an ex vivo tonsil model of HIV infection, germinal center B cells (germinal center B cells) upregulate HIV expression in TFH. Gene expression analysis revealed germinal center B cells induce expression of multiple cytokines including IL-10, pro-survival molecules, and markers of immune activation. Further studies revealed that upregulation of HIV expression is not confined to germinal center B cells, but that multiple subsets of tonsil B cells upregulate HIV replication in both TFH and non-TFH CD4+ T cells. IL-10 was shown to augment survival of HIV-expressing cells in the tonsil model, and we observed that the majority of Viral RNA expressing cells in spleen from two people with HIV expressed IL-10. We hypothesize that B cells are major drivers of vRNA expression in CD4+ T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues of people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy through induction of prosurvival factors, including IL-10, as well as immune activation. In Aim 1, we will determine the location, phenotype, and microenvironment of Viral RNA expressing cells in spleen, lymph nodes, and ileum of people with HIV on prolonged antiretroviral therapy using state-of-the-art immunostaining techniques to assess the hypothesis that Viral RNA expressing cells preferentially exist adjacent to B cells and express pro-survival and activation markers. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the impact of secondary lymphoid tissues B cells on HIV expression in non-TFH CD4+ T cells, and evaluate the role of IL-10 and immune activation using HIV GFP reporter viruses in secondary lymphoid tissues from people without HIV infection, as well as spleen and lymph node tissues from people with HIV infection on prolonged antiretroviral therapy. In Aim 3 we will determine whether depletion of B cells leads to reductions in numbers of Viral RNA expressing cells in secondary lymphoid tissues during antiretroviral therapy using SIV-infected rhesus macaques. Collectively, these studies will provide a wealth of new information on the cells that express HIV in secondary lymphoid tissues and factors within their microenvironment that promote or impair HIV expression during antiretroviral therapy. This knowledge could be used to develop strategies to reverse or alternatively enhance viral latency in vivo to achieve a functional remission of HIV.",1,1R56AI181705-01,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

A common strategy that listeners use in such situations is to use the linguistic context to fill in gaps in comprehension. Older adults tend to do well with this, at least in laboratory situations: given a meaningful linguistic context, their word recognition is much more like young adults' than when speech is meaningless. An open question is what cognitive mechanisms underly this ability. Based on research in young adults, it is widely believed that prediction plays a central role in language processing - listeners could predict upcoming words from a meaningful context, and thus compensate for noisy input. Yet, a line of research using an electroencephalography (electroencephalography) signature of predictive language processing, the N400, suggests that predictive processing is impaired in older adults. This raises the question of how, then, older adults can successfully use context to facilitate speech recognition. This proposal uses cutting-edge neuroimaging techniques to examine a wider range of predictive speech processing than previous work, as well as nonpredictive compensatory mechanisms, in younger and older adults. To maximize relevance to older adults' realworld experience, brain responses are measured while listening to continuous narrative speech, in quiet and in multi-talker babble background noise, approximating conditions in a busy restaurant. electroencephalography is used to model the temporal dynamics of predictive language processing at multiple levels (acoustic-phonetic, sublexical, lexical, sentential). This will test several hypothesis that older adults use predictions during speech processing, but at different levels than young adults. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (Functional magnetic resonance imaging) is used to characterize language networks related to speech processing in quiet and in noise. Whereas previous research has mostly relied on small sample sizes, obscuring individual differences, this work will be based on a large dataset, adequately powered for individual difference analysis, and will collect a range of individual variables that may be related to speech comprehension, such as hearing ability, working memory span and inhibitory functioning. This work will relate individual differences in prediction at multiple levels of the processing hierarchy to language, cognitive, and functional outcomes. Together, this work aims to uncover which cognitive strategies (predictive or non-predictive), neural representations and network are related to successful speech comprehension in older adults. By relating neural measures to comprehension, it will distinguish between successful compensation and maladaptive changes in brain activation. The dataset will be shared publicly, providing a unique testbed for future researchers interested in speech and aging.",1,1R01DC020961-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,0,1,5,1

Children homo or heterozygous for this allele who had a medically attended respiratory viral illness before age 2, had a 12 (any virus) to 18-fold (RSV) increased risk of asthma. The mechanisms for this association are not established. PAI1 is associated with airway thymic stromal lymphopoietin (thymic stromal lymphopoietin) production, which promotes Th2 type airway responses. Furthermore, the PAI-1 overproducing genotype is associated with increased serum levels of IgE. IgE elevation increases FcεRI levels on pDCs which attenuates type I interferon antiviral responses. Of note, soy isoflavones reduce TGF-1-induced PAI-1 gene expression and protein production from airway epithelial cells, and have been shown to decrease the risk of asthma exacerbations by 70% in individuals with the genotype. It is not known whether supplementation with soy isoflavones will decrease the risk of developing Th2 airway inflammation or the likelihood of allergic sensitization if it is given to children at risk of asthma in the first year of life. Soy Isoflavones for Inner City Infants at Risk for Asthma (SIRA) is a single center, prospective randomized, quadruple masked trial of high-risk infants with the PAI-1 genotype to compare supplementation with soy genistein at doses similar to soy formula ingestion or placebo during peak viral season of the first year of life. Children aged 2-6 months at enrollment will be randomized to soy isoflavone or placebo in August, receiving active treatment from August to March 1st, followed by observation over the next year for each yearly cohort. The objective of this proposal is to determine 1) whether soy isoflavones can modulate development of Th2 airway endotypes, decrease eosinophilic airway inflammation, and reduce sensitization in high risk infants with the PAI-1 risk genotype, and 2) decrease IgE production via effects on PAI-1, and thereby improve rhinovirus-induced IFN-α response. As such, the primary outcome of the trial will be the development of T2 airway endotypes by interrupting the PAI-1/thymic stromal lymphopoietin axis. Secondary outcomes will include nasal PAI-1, nasal ECP, nasal Th2 cytokine levels, serum periostin, total and specific IgE, and respiratory morbidity. The secondary aim will determine if antiviral IFN-α responses by PBMC stimulated by HRV and IgE crosslinking are augmented by soy genistein in a similar fashion as has been described for omalizumab. Secondary outcomes for this aim will evaluate if soy genistein will augment IFN-α responses by pDC in similar experiments. The current project uses a safe and inexpensive intervention, soy genistein, directed to a common genotype as a precision medicine approach to provide a better understanding of key pathways relevant to development of allergic airway inflammation in early life. If confirmatory, these results would lead into intervention trials focused on clinical outcomes. This line of inquiry has the potential to benefit a large number of children at risk of developing asthma.",5,5U01AI160018-04,RFA-AI-19-073,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,3,4,1,3

While reversion events are commonly detected, mutations in DNA end resection proteins are less frequently reported in patients, and the molecular drivers of clinical resistance in many BRCA1 cancers remain unknown. In this proposal, we have identified genes that when mutated do not impact resection, but restore PALB2 recruitment and induce PARPi resistance. We now hypothesize that PARPi resistance can occur when mutations occur in genes that function to block PALB2 recruitment to sites of DNA damage. However, mechanistic details remain to be defined. The rationale for the proposed research is that PALB2 inhibitory proteins play a role in regulating mammalian DNA repair, and loss of function events may account for a significant portion of PARPi resistant patient cancers where RAD51 activity is restored, but mutations in DNA end resection genes or BRCA1 reversion mutations are not detected. We will validate these resistance pathways in relevant mouse models of BRCA1 mutant cancer. We will address the following Specific Aims: 1) define molecular features of PALB2 required for homologous recombination.; 2) elucidate mechanisms of PALB2 inhibition; and 3) examine the role of PALB2 regulators in PARPi resistance. Collectively, these studies have the potential to reveal new paradigms for DNA repair pathway choice and therapy response and resistance.",2,2R01CA214799-06A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,10,10,2,4

For pre-pubertal girls or women requiring immediate chemotherapy, ovarian hyperstimulation is unavailable and many of these patients opt to cryopreserve ovarian tissue with subsequent auto-transplantation once in remission. The increasing frequency of ovarian tissue cryopreservation (ovarian tissue cryopreservation) portends a surge in future demand for auto-transplantation, yet the viability/function of grafts is significantly undermined by post-transplant ischemia. Moreover, the iatrogenic influence of chemotherapeutic agents and/or the inflammatory milieu present following tissue autotransplantation upsets the inter-follicular homeostasis that governs healthy ovarian physiology. We have developed an approach that utilizes cultured vascular cells to accelerate perfusion of transplanted ovarian tissue. In addition, we have demonstrated the potential for an ovary-specific secreted factor, anti-Müllerian hormone (anti-Müllerian hormone), to modulate follicular growth and activation. The goals of this proposal are to combine these technologies to enhanced tissue viability and follicular output in the context of auto-transplantation and/or mitigate the negative influence of chemotherapeutic agents on the ovary in situ. The proposal aims to address this burgeoning unmet need by: 1) improving viability and output of ovarian tissue grafts by cotransplanting patient-matched vascular endothelial cells isolated at the time of ovarian tissue cryopreservation; 2) manipulating signaling within the graft site at the time of ovarian tissue transplantation to repress premature follicular mobilization; and 3) mitigating the gonadotoxic influence of alkylating chemotherapy via pre-conditioning of ovarian tissue with anti-Müllerian hormone. In pursuing these goals, the proposal stands to improve outcomes for thousands of women who have undergone or will undergo ovarian tissue cryopreservation, while also aiming to forego in future patients the risk, expense, pain, and uncertainty of ovarian tissue cryopreservation and auto-transplantation.",5,5R01HD112441-02,PA-20-185,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,11,7,2,0

Germinal centers (Germinal centers) are microanatomical structures formed in secondary lymphoid organs during antigenstimulated immune responses. Germinal centers are the sites of B cell maturation through clonal expansion, somatic hypermutation, and affinity-mediated selection -- and therefore play a critical role in differentiation of antibody secreting cells and memory B cells. OCA-B is a unique transcriptional coactivator that is highly expressed in GC B cells and GC-derived lymphomas such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt's lymphoma. In vivo studies have demonstrated that OCA-B is essential for both antigen-dependent B cell differentiation (including GC formation) and normal expression of secondary immunoglobulin genes. However, little is known about the exact role of OCA-B in normal GC formation and GC-derived lymphoma progression. In addition, the mechanism by which OCA-B regulates its target genes is also unclear. In addressing these issues, our preliminary studies have demonstrated (i) a functional occupancy of OCA-B on distal enhancers, in particular the large locus control region (locus control region) of the BCL6 gene that encodes a master regulator of GC formation; (ii) direct interactions of OCAB with the MED1 subunit of the Mediator coactivator complex and with a GC-specific transcription factor (MEF2B) important for BCL6 expression and (in vitro transcription assays;) a B cell-intrinsic Oca-B dependency for GC B cell differentiation in vivo. Based on our previous OCA-B studies and recent preliminary data, we hypothesize that a predominant role of OCA-B in GC formation involves activation of BCL6 through its distal enhancer region by recruiting and concentrating transcription factors and cofactors, including chromatin/epigenetic factors, that facilitate enhancerpromoter interactions. We also hypothesis that OCA-B plays a critical role in GC-derived lymphomagenesis. To address these issues, we will investigate (i) the function and mechanism of action of OCA-B, through interactions with MED1/Mediator and MEF2B, on the BCL6 locus control region/super-enhancer in both ex vivo GC B and lymphoma cells, (ii) the mechanism of action of OCA-B-dependent transcriptional coactivation through rigorous biochemical in vitro transcription assays; (in vitro transcription assays;) the mechanism of action of OCA-B in GC B cell differentiation in vivo, including identification of key target genes and regulatory networks; (iv) the role of OCA-B in B cell lymphoma progression in vivo. We will use complementary biochemical, genomic, bioinformatic, genetic, gene-editing, cell-based and in vivo (mouse model) approaches. Completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of action of OCA-B in GC-specific transcriptional regulation, GC B cell differentiation, and GCderived B cell lymphomagenesis.

This fascinating process involves changes in spatio-temporal gene activity and genome organization. Disruptions in chromosomal interactions and gene expression can lead to developmental disorders or cancer. Despite the remarkable emerging views on multi-scale genome architecture and gene regulation, our knowledge is still very limited on how maternal and paternal genomes are accommodated in each cell to achieve diverse cellular identities. Moreover, it remains poorly understood how structural heterozygosity between parents may impact genome structure and function to tip over cell state from normal to dysfunctional. Challenges in distinction between homologous chromosomes, especially at single cell resolution, have hampered our ability to ask pressing questions about variability and heterogeneity of parental genomes and related functional significance. Our previous work involved the development of complementary approaches including haplotype-specific omics and transformative single-cell imaging to distinguish homologs. Our goal is to leverage these powerful approaches to determine how packaging and functional regulation of diploid genomes are formed and maintained, and how disrupted genome integrity affects cell fate. Specifically, we will determine how parental contribution influences intricate early genome packing and regulation. Furthermore, we will investigate plasticity in establishment and maintenance of single-cell identities within tissues. Finally, we will uncover how heterozygosity in parental content including transposons affects genome integrity, and thereby increase our understanding of parental genome compatibility and organismal viability.

The mechanisms underlying transmission are complex, with both bacterial and host factors playing important roles. It would be expected the capacity is sense and response to the dynamic environment of the mammalian host is critical for transmission, however the regulation underscoring this process remains poorly understood. We hypothesize transmission is controlled via a specific, uncharacterized twocomponent regulatory system (TCS11). This TCS has atypical operon structure for pneumococcal TCSs, whereby two small hypothetical proteins and a putative transporter are in the same operon and co-transcribed with TCS11. Preliminary data suggests is this operon is in fact a TCS coupled to a bacteriocin secretion system that facilitates transmission via targeting the resident bacterial flora, enabling pneumococcal transmission. We hypothesize that TCS11 mediates pneumococcal transmission via coordination of transmission factor gene expression coupled with bacteriocin production to effectively compete against the respiratory microbiota at the initial stages of epithelial colonization.",1,1R21AI178084-01A1,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3
10753511,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/0hoFb63E90SrMSiEb_eSpg/project-details/10753511#similar-Projects,Molecular Basis of Centromere Specification and Inheritance,"A fundamental but poorly understood process in eukaryotic cells is how cells structure their genomes into distinct functional domains. This project addresses this gap in knowledge by studying the centromere, a specific chromatin domain found in all eukaryotes. This stably propagated locus guides the assembly of kinetochores to ensure proper segregation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. Mis-regulation of centromeres adversely affects chromosome segregation resulting in aneuploidy, a condition found in more than 90% of all cancers. Aneuploidy contributes to the development of many diseases, such as cancer and Down syndrome. The goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the specification and inheritance of centromeres. In most eukaryotes, centromeres are epigenetically governed by the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A. CENP-A partially replaces canonical histone H3 at centromeres, and provides the foundation for the assembly of kinetochores. Centromeres are usually embedded in epigenetically distinct heterochromatin, the transcriptionally silenced chromatin domain. Assembly of CENP-A at centromeres is cell cycle-regulated. Parental CENP-A is partitioned equally among daughter centromeres following DNA replication, whereas loading of newly synthesized CENP-A to centromeres is uncoupled from DNA replication. How CENP-A chromatin at centromeres is assembled throughout the cell cycle remains poorly understood. Mislocalization of CENP-A to non-centromeric regions has a devastating impact on chromosome segregation, and has been linked to a variety of cancers. Ubiquitinmediated proteolysis of CENP-A is a conserved mechanism to prevent CENP-A mislocalization. But how noncentromeric regions are protected from CENP-A mis-incorporation in normal cells is largely unexplored. In addition, CENP-A in centromeres is interspersed with the canonical histone H3. The histone H3 within centromeres is actually vital for proper assembly of CENP-A chromatin. How CENP-A and H3 levels are properly balanced in centromeres is unknown. We propose to use fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) to address these outstanding questions. Fission yeast is a simple eukaryotic model organism with many aspects of centromere regulation conserved with humans. It is particularly suited to an interdisciplinary approach that includes genetics, genomics, cytology, biochemistry, and structural biology. We propose to: 1) define the mechanisms underlying cell cycle-dependent CENP-A assembly at centromeres, 2) determine how formation of ectopic CENP-A chromatin is prevented, 3) identify regulatory mechanism for how CENP-A and histone H3 levels are balanced at centromeres. Our study also provides important new insights into the role of heterochromatin in centromere function. Given that epigenetic regulation in fission yeast is conserved, our studies will shed light on the processes governing chromosome segregation in human cells, and contribute to a better understanding of human diseases resulting from centromere misregulation.",5,5R35GM134920-05,PAR-17-094,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,10,10,2,4

Most studies are limited to 1-dimensional genomic data that measure transcription level (RNAseq), protein binding intensity (ChIP-seq), and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq). These datasets lack direct evidence of communication between various regulatory elements that accommodate gene regulation and differentiation. To solve this problem, we will leverage cutting-edge 3D genome technologies, ChIA-PET and ChIA-Drop. By enriching for specific protein factors CCCTC binding factor (CCCTC binding factor) and RNA Polymerase II (RNA Polymerase II), one can interrogate chromatin architecture and gene regulation in aggregated bulk cells (ChIA-PET) and in a single molecule (ChIA-Drop). We will exploit the highly dissimilar genomes in F1 hybrid mouse strains derived from mating a laboratory mouse and a wild mouse to assign high-throughput sequencing reads to parental origin, thereby unraveling the allele-specific gene expression and chromatin interactions. We propose to: (i) determine whether allele-specific interactions between regulatory elements and methylation status in mouse embryonic stem cells (mouse embryonic stem cells) drive allele-specific gene expression, (ii) quantify cell-to-cell heterogeneity of multiplex chromatin interactions. We will subsequently differentiate mouse embryonic stem cells into three lineage-specific precursors ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm in vitro. By performing ChIA-PET, we can identify which, if any, of the pre-established interactions among enhancers, promoters, and CCCTC binding factor persist or vanish after this process. ChIA-Drop data will potentially capture the dynamics therein. Throughout the K99 and R00 phases, we will continue to develop computational algorithms that can: (i) quantitatively assess reproducibility of replicate experiments, (ii) identify statistically significant differential interactions, and (iii) trace and quantify singlemolecule dynamics and heterogeneity of allele-specific multiplex interactions. To succeed in these aims, the investigator will expand her knowledge domain to developmental biology and receive additional hands-on experimental training in 3D genome mapping technologies and mouse embryonic stem cell culture, harvest, and differentiation techniques.

The circadian clock, our intrinsic timer, is a pivotal cellular mechanism to promote health and healthy aging, as both lossand gain-of-function studies have provided strong experimental evidence for a causative role of circadian rhythms in aging. This is important because in humans, environmental circadian disruptions associated with modern 24/7 lifestyles also aggravate disease risk and age-related decline. Despite growing functional insights, a significant gap in knowledge remains regarding cellular mechanisms and interventional strategies that impinge on circadian timing to promote healthy aging. The Receptor (Retinoid acid receptor-related Orphan Receptor) subfamily of nuclear receptors are key clock components, functioning to sustain oscillatory robustness and phase which is known to alter with age. We previously identified an agonist of Receptors called Nobiletin (Nobiletin) and demonstrated a strong efficacy of Nobiletin to improve physiological fitness in disease models and aged mice. Extending the pharmacological gain-of-function studies, we recently generated muscle-specific double knockout of Rora and Rorc in mice (Ror mDKO), and found that adult and aged Ror mDKO mice showed impaired skeletal muscle function and mitochondrial dysfunction in a circadian timedependent manner. Importantly, circadian transcriptomic analysis showed significantly altered circadian expression (level, amplitude and phase) of OXPHOS genes. We hypothesize that Receptors control mitochondrial respiration and skeletal muscle function via circadian transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, and play a modifiable role in lifestyle interventions to enhance healthy aging. In Aim 1, we will comprehensively investigate the role of Receptors in ageand circadian time-dependent changes in mitochondrial activity and homeostasis in skeletal muscle. In Aim 2, we will determine circadian transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms by Receptors in skeletal muscle, especially in the concerted regulation of OXPHOS gene expression. In Aim 3, combining timed exercise and Nobiletin treatment, we will determine the requisite role of Receptors in circadian interventions to prolong healthspan and lifespan. Together, the proposed studies will provide key mechanistic insights into circadian regulation of skeletal muscle mitochondria, and pinpoint Receptors as an actionable target for lifestyle interventions to enhance healthy aging.

Given the comorbidity of alcohol dependence and disorders of affect such as depression is extremely high, it has been posited that self-medication of negative affective states contributes to continued excessive alcohol use and relapse. Furthermore, negative affective states produced by chronic alcohol exposure can influence the neurocircuitry of cognitive control systems to perpetuate further excessive alcohol use. Once that degree of dysregulation is reached, components of the dependence cycle serve to facilitate each other in a manner that is extremely deleterious to personal, familial and societal welfare. The principal investigator's long-term goal is to identify effective therapeutic targets and strategies for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (alcohol use disorder). The objective of this application, which is the next step in pursuit of that goal, is to understand the neuroadaptations in Oprk1 (kappa-opioid receptor gene)-regulated systems that occur in response to chronic alcohol exposure and contribute to maladaptive behavioral regulation. The central hypothesis is that the Oprk1-regulated neurocircuitry becomes progressively dysregulated in a manner that promotes the continued excessive consumption of alcohol and perpetuates the cycle of alcohol dependence. The rationale for the proposed studies is that understanding the contribution of dysregulated Oprk1 expression in alcohol use disorder will lay the foundation for the development of effective therapies designed to alleviate maladaptive behavioral regulation produced by alcohol dependence. This hypothesis will be tested by utilizing inducible and conditional CRISPR/CAS9 gene editing and chemogenetic approaches to recapitulate or ameliorate symptoms of alcohol dependence in non-selected and transgenic rats. Animal models of operant alcohol self-administration, negative affective-like behavior and executive function including working memory will serve as functional end-points to systematically investigate the role of Oprk1 expression in maladaptive behavioral regulation related to alcohol dependence. In addition, Oprk1 gene expression will be assessed as a complement to the behavioral approaches. The proposed research will help to identify the functional importance of neuroadaptations in Oprk1-regulated systems that result from chronic alcohol exposure and will provide much needed information regarding the influence of Oprk1 on the neurocircuitry of alcohol use disorder-related phenotypes. Such a contribution is significant because it will help identify and develop therapeutic targets to treat alcohol use disorder that focus on the removal of maladaptive phenotypes; a strategy that should greatly increase treatment compliance and decrease rates of relapse.",5,5R01AA031171-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM,0,1,8,2

Critically, aversive consequences following a substantial delay, such as withdrawal after substance use, are often underestimated. Despite the common occurrence of delayed punishment, cost/benefit decision-making research has focused almost entirely on punishment occurring immediately after a choice. To address this gap, we developed the Delayed Punishment Decision-making Task (Delayed Punishment Decision-making Task), which reveals that rats, like humans, underestimate or ""discount"" the negative value of delayed punishment during decision-making. Preliminary data obtained using Delayed Punishment Decision-making Task reveal that orbitofrontal cortex (orbitofrontal cortex) inactivation increases sensitivity to delayed punishment, and orbitofrontal cortex encodes information about punishment delay prior to choice. While these data suggest a role of orbitofrontal cortex in the assessment of delayed punishment, the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. orbitofrontal cortex activity is sculpted by catecholaminergic projections from distinct midbrain nuclei, specifically dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (ventral tegmental area) and noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus (locus coeruleus). Our central hypothesis is that sensitivity to delayed punishment is modulated by dopamine and norepinephrine projections to orbitofrontal cortex, with dopamine release from neurons arising from ventral tegmental area affecting the discounting of delayed punishment, and noradrenergic neurons from locus coeruleus regulating sensitivity to punishment regardless of delay. We will evaluate this using DREADDS for both circuit and cell-type specific manipulation of neural activity in locus coeruleus or ventral tegmental area neurons projecting to orbitofrontal cortex during Delayed Punishment Decision-making Task. In Aim 1, we will use infuse inhibitory or excitatory DREADDS into the ventral tegmental area of TH-Cre rats, then directly stimulate these receptors in the orbitofrontal cortex terminals prior to Delayed Punishment Decision-making Task. This will enable selective modulation of dopamine release in orbitofrontal cortex. For Aim 2, we will infuse excitatory or inhibitory DREADDS into locus coeruleus, then stimulate these receptors in orbitofrontal cortex prior to Delayed Punishment Decision-making Task. For all manipulations in both Aims, we will perform control experiments to confirm that manipulations are affecting sensitivity to immediate or delayed punishment rather than pain tolerance, reward discrimination, or behavioral flexibility. Collectively, these studies will determine a potential mechanism for how the orbitofrontal cortex regulates sensitivity to both delayed and immediate punishment. Moreover, these experiments will determine if direct manipulation of two understudied neuronal circuits has efficacy as a potential treatment to improve sensitivity to delayed consequences in substance use disorder.",5,5R21DA058160-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,0,1,5,1

These factors include visual selective attention, in which sensory information is filtered in favor of items that are behaviorally and contextually relevant. In addition, it includes the modulation of visual processing during saccadic eye movements which occur several times each second. These factors are known to modulate the processing of visual information and to contribute to adaptive visually guided behavior. In the primate brain, the visual and oculomotor systems are highly interconnected, and past work has shown that movement-related signals exert robust influences on visual processing in visual cortex. The current proposal focuses on addressing key questions concerning the role of gaze control mechanisms in visual selection and visual stability, two ways in which those mechanisms clearly influence visual perception and cognition. These questions will be addressed using a broad set of innovative approaches and tools including newly developed, large-scale, high-density Neuropixels (Neuropixels) probes made specifically for use in nonhuman primates. In this first aim, we will test the role of persistent activity in the selection of visual signals and in visually guided saccades in a set of key, complementary experiments that include large-scale neurophysiological recordings with primate Neuropixels probes. Our hypothesis is that persistent activity in the frontal eye field (frontal eye field) serves primarily to select the visual information required to guide saccadic eye movements, and that this function is mediated by dopamine D1Rs. In the second aim, we will address a major open question regarding the basis of stimulus-driven attention by testing the contribution of posterior parietal cortex (posterior parietal cortex) to the representation of visual salience in the brain, and to saliency-driven behavior. Experiments in this aim combine the use of reversible inactivation of posterior parietal cortex with largescale neurophysiological recordings and behavior. In the third aim, we will address another major open question regarding the basis of the distortions in vision that occur during saccadic eye movements. We will leverage the use of large-scale recordings, and the use of reversible parietal inactivation to test the role of posterior parietal cortex in perisaccadic changes in visual processing within extrastriate visual cortex and the frontal eye field. Overall, our focus on the influence of gaze control mechanisms on visual processing, combined with our use of state-of-the-art neurophysiological approaches and causal methods, are likely to produce results that exert a large and sustained impact on our understanding of the neural mechanisms of visual perception and cognition.",5,5R01EY014924-19,PA-19-056,NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE,0,1,5,1

In humans, there is a strong connection between metabolic network dysfunction and disease, while in microbes metabolic network structure dictates organismal capabilities, including pathogenesis. Metabolic strategies are conserved across biology, and insights obtained from model organisms provide the means to advance our understanding of general metabolic paradigms, which can often be extrapolated to higher organisms including humans. The PI's laboratory utilizes a broad approach that includes in vivo genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics, proteomics, and metabolomics and other global approaches to address timely questions in metabolism. In the long-term, the PI's research will contribute to the understanding of the structure and integration of bacterial metabolic networks, how they respond to perturbation, and how specialized capabilities (e.g., causing disease) are integrated into metabolism. Reaching this vision will require the rigorous definition of metabolic components and their integration, which together form the complex system of metabolism. Knowledge of fundamental metabolic processes and a mechanistic understanding of functional components is critical to efforts aimed at treating metabolic diseases, defining pathogenic strategies, and targeting metabolism for rational drug design, synthetic biology, microbiome research, etc. Efforts in the next five years focus on, i) extending the understanding of the RidA stress system, ii) comparing the endogenous stress systems of multiple microbes, iii) identifying functions of additional Rid protein family members, iv) integrating results from these studies into the metabolism of pyridoxal phosphate, and v) defining a function for the conserved YggS protein. Notably, the human YggS homolog (i.e., PROSC) is a biomarker in B6 epilepsy in humans. The goals of this proposal will be accomplished through a combination of chemical, biochemical, molecular genetics, bioinformatics and global approaches. The work here is motivated by our desire to understand the complex system of metabolism, specifically understanding metabolic stress generated by the production of reactive metabolites during growth, how such stress can damage cellular components if not neutralized and discovering a unifying role for the members of the broadly conserved Rid protein superfamily family.",1,1R35GM153189-01,PAR-22-180,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

Molecular motors help to establish polarity by transporting mRNAs, proteins, vesicles, and organelles to specific sites within the cell. A variety of organisms from the single-celled yeast to humans use mRNA localization coupled with translational regulation as a way to asymmetrically sort proteins. The prevalence of this phenomenon is best illustrated in developing embryos, neurons and epithelial, in which thousands of mRNAs are spatially localized. When this process is compromised, it can result in developmental and neurological disorders. Despite the importance of this topic and the prevalence of this phenomenon, we lack a mechanistic understanding of mRNA localization. A critical gap in our understanding pertains to how mRNAs destined for localization are recognized by the cell and distinguished from non-localizing mRNAs. In addition to sequences present within localizing mRNAs, the proteins that bind these mRNAs are key to their cellular fate. This complex of proteins is responsible for linking localizing mRNAs with molecular motors and for regulating their translation. However, identifying these critical proteins has proven to be extremely challenging. By its very nature, the process of mRNA localization is highly dynamic. Consequently, the protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions required for assembling localizing messenger ribonucleoprotein (messenger ribonucleoprotein) particles are weak and transient. This has made their identification using classical biochemical approaches almost impossible; the complex falls apart during the purification step. In this application, we propose novel strategies to address this critical knowledge gap. The model we propose to use for these studies is the well-characterized Drosophila melanogaster egg chamber. In Objective 1 of this application, we propose to use proximity biotin ligation to define the core components of transport particles and to examine the conservation of these factors between flies and mammals. In Objective 2, we propose to test the hypothesis that granular structures referred to as P bodies coordinate the localization of mRNAs with their translational regulation.",5,5R35GM145340-03,PAR-19-367,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,10,10,2,0

Salience is dynamic. What is salient to an animal changes from moment to moment in accord with its experience and current physiological need. A prime example observed widely across species is the salience of food-associated stimuli. These stimuli are salient for food-deprived animals and therefore demand their attention. By contrast, food-associated stimuli lose their salience when animals become satiated. This indicates that neural circuits that control attentional behavior integrates the information of hunger and satiety. Appropriately determining salience based on current need and thereby regulating attention is essential for survival and its dysregulation is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. However, it is not known what neural circuits mediate attentional behavior and how these circuits integrate internal information of hunger and satiety. Here we propose to use Drosophila as a model to dissect neural circuits that control attentional behavior to food-associated olfactory stimuli in accord with hunger and satiety. We employ a multidisciplinary approach that combines a novel behavioral assay, a novel bidirectional neural activity reporter, genetic and optogenetic manipulations, and in vivo recording of neural activity to test our hypothesis that a dopamine-modulated olfactory center, the mushroom body, plays a key role in appropriately computing salience of food-associated odors based on current hunger state. In Aim 1, we will establish that the salience of food odor is modulated by hunger state and will determine the role of mushroom body in generating attentional response to olfactory stimuli. In Aim 2, we will identify hunger-sensitive dopamine neurons, whose activity is modulated by signals reflecting hunger and satiety. In Aim 3, we will identify mushroom body output that integrates information of food odors and hunger state to drive attentional behavior. Together, our studies will reveal the neural mechanisms that regulate attentional behavior in response to food-associated odors in accord with hunger state. The functional organization of the Drosophila mushroom body exhibits remarkable similarity to that of the mammalian striatum and its dopamine input, and the dopamine circuits in mammals have long been implicated in computation of salience. Therefore, we expect that our project will contribute to providing an understanding of the operational principles of neural circuits that mediate salience determination.",5,5R01DK132705-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,0,1,5,1

For example, a sudden intense sound that indicates danger should trigger an acoustic startle response, but an innocuous sound should not. This type of behavioral threshold is a basic mechanism for sensorimotor filtering, and the importance of setting this threshold appropriately is highlighted by the startle hypersensitivity observed in neuropsychiatric diseases such as autism, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Despite its importance, and in contrast to our knowledge of experience-dependent startle modulation, the molecular and cellular pathways that establish and maintain the innate startle threshold are not well characterized. By developing a more complete understanding of the biological mechanisms that govern the startle threshold, we can generate new hypotheses about the neural bases for these diseases. This project will leverage the powerful larval zebrafish model system to investigate the molecular-genetic and neural circuit bases of the startle threshold. Here a simple, conserved, and genetically accessible circuit drives a stereotyped startle response, with auditory afferents triggering reticulospinal neurons to activate motor neurons and initiate movement. In a recent genome-wide screen, we identified a novel regulator of the innate startle threshold: cytoplasmic Fragile X mental retardation protein 2 (cyfip2 (Fragile X mental retardation protein 2 (cyfip2) interacting protein 2 (cyfip2 2 (cyfip2). cyfip2 mutants are hypersensitive and startle to low intensity sounds that rarely startle wild-types. Cyfip2 acts through Fragile X mental retardation protein 2 (cyfip2 and eIF4E to regulate RNA translation, but it can also control actin polymerization through interactions with Rac1 and the WAVE regulatory complex (WAVE regulatory complex). In Aim 1 we will systematically test which of these molecular pathways cyfip2 uses to establish the startle threshold and to maintain it through development. In Aim 2 we will define the cellular basis for cyfip2mediated threshold control by first locating the site of the primary circuit defect with optogenetic and calcium imaging approaches and then identifying the cell types in which cyfip2 is needed for normal startle sensitivity. Finally, our data show that acute manipulation of the actin cytoskeleton substantially alters the startle threshold while also decreasing the number and size of excitatory synapses in inhibitory glycinergic neurons but not excitatory glutamatergic neurons. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that cyfip2 acts cell-autonomously to maintain excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance, combining behavioral recording with live imaging of neuronal activity and synaptic scaffolds to define direct links between cyfip2, circuit structure and function, and behavior. Overall, the results of this work will generate a detailed model of molecular and cellular pathways that control the startle behavior threshold and lay a foundation for understanding how these may be affected in human disease.",5,5R01NS116354-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is now the third leading cause of death in the world, but how best to identify individuals remains a significant challenge, as symptoms alone are not sensitive enough to identify those at greatest risk. Hence, there is a critical need to find a better way to identify high risk individuals who require targeted pulmonary function testing. Providing a potential solution, lung cancer screening has now been widely adopted and is recommended by the US Preventive Task Force and paid for by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for individuals aged 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history. Given the wealth of information that low-dose computed tomography (low-dose computed tomography) for lung cancer screening provides, this represents an unprecedented opportunity to leverage what is now routinely collected data to improve the overall health of this patient population. Estimates suggest that roughly 35% of those undergoing lung cancer screening CT scans have undiagnosed Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Our group has already reported on a subset of individuals from the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (National Lung Cancer Screening Trial) that quantitative analysis of emphysema from low-dose computed tomography can be used to help detect individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. However, despite recognition of the problem, this solution has yet to be widely implemented. Radiologists remain unclear on what to tell primary care physicians; primary care physicians are also unclear on what to do with information they are provided, even when radiologists do mention the presence of emphysema in an low-dose computed tomography report. Our overall objective with this proposal is to develop a tool based on data collected as part of lung cancer screening to enable clinicians to identify risk for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Our central hypothesis is that a quantitative, imagingbased Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease risk tool can help identify undiagnosed patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. We will test our hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1 we will a) use quantitative imaging analysis to characterize the range of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease-related pathology from low-dose computed tomography scans from National Lung Cancer Screening Trial and b) formulate an advanced multivariable model integrating diverse quantitative imaging attributes to determine the probability of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. In Aim 2, we will build a user-informed communication tool designed for clinicians but understandable by patients to facilitate screening for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease by determining a) primary care provider beliefs, attitudes and approaches to the interpretation of low-dose computed tomography findings; and b) patient understanding regarding risk for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and interpretation of lung cancer screening scans. Upon completion, the risk tool developed is expected to have an important positive impact by paving the way for future interventional studies with the tool that could be implemented at a health system level to reduce the burden of undiagnosed Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.",1,1R01HL174648-01,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",17,8,7,4

Although significant progress has been made in discovering regional functions that are common across individuals, we know little about how structure-function relationships differ between individuals. Recent evidence suggests that there are many such individual differences in brain activity, with factors like genetics and sex have outsize influence on patterns of brain activity. But the molecular basis of these differences, and their consequences for behavior, are unknown. To begin exploring this new territory, we will  identify brain regions whose relationship to behavior is influenced by genetics and sex, and  identify neurotransmitters and receptors that underlie the influence of genes and sex on brain function and behavior. We will do this by measuring patterns of whole-brain activity that underlie exploratory behavior and long-term memory recall in adult zebrafish. Zebrafish are a genetically tractable animal model with several characteristics that make them ideal for the present research: a small and simple morphology, a sophisticated behavioral repertoire, and ease of genetic manipulation. As vertebrates, zebrafish retain a high similarity to mammals in genetics and nervous system organization. Given that many mental health disorders manifest as alterations in patterns of neural activity, understanding how individual differences in biology influence brain function and behavior will inform the development of precision approaches for the treatment of disorders localized to the brain.",5,5R35GM142566-04,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,0,1,5,1

The eukaryotic Rev1/3/7-dependent pathway of mutagenic translesion synthesis is critically important to human health, not only because it can help cells to survive by tolerating environmental DNA damage, including the repair of DNA crosslinks, but also because this molecular process is responsible for the vast majority of the mutagenesis that occurs as a result of damage to DNA. Mutations from environmental exposure contribute to cancer, other human diseases, and aging. Rev1 is member of the Y family of translesion synthesis DNA polymerases, while Rev3 and Rev7 respectively are the catalytic and non-catalytic subunits of translesion synthesis DNA pol ζ. The overall goal of this research is to build on exciting progress funded by NIEHS grant R01-ES015818 by taking advantage of new developments in human and mammalian biology to gain detailed new insights into the mechanism, regulation, and physiological consequences of this Rev1/3/7-dependent process at a level of resolution that has historically only been attainable using organisms with sophisticated genetic systems such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A particularly innovative component of this research is to develop a suite of novel inhibitors and other strategies to interfere with Rev1/3/7-dependent translesion synthesis, DNA crosslink repair, and other Rev1/3/7-related processes. These will not only be powerful probes to advance basic research into how organisms respond to DNA from environmental chemicals, but also have the potential to improve chemotherapy and possibly other aspects of human health. One major strategy is to identify small molecules that inhibit Rev1/3/7-dependent mutagenic translesion synthesis by interfering with critical interactions required for operation of the pathway, such as the interaction of the Rev1 100 amino acid C-terminal domain (C-terminal domain) with the Rev7 component of DNA pol ζ through one interface and the RIR (Rev1-interacting region) of other translesion synthesis DNA polymerases through a second interface. Exemplar compounds have already been identified that bind to each Rev1 Interface and have the expected biological effects. These will be evaluated in syngeic mouse models of human lung cancer and lymphoma as possible chemotherapy adjuvants that increase killing while also reducing the mutagenesis that gives rise to resistance. Other innovative approaches to inhibiting Rev1/3/7-dependent mutagenic translesion synthesis include using stapled RIR peptides, using the Anthrax Protective Antigen to deliver the Rev1 C-terminal domain into mammalian cells by fusing it to the N-terminus of Lethal Factor, and testing whether Rev7-interacting sequences can serve as dominant negative inhibitors by trapping Rev7 in nonproductive complexes. In a complementary approach, a series of partial-loss-of-function mutants affecting proteins in the Rev1/3/7-dependent-pathway will yield detailed functional insights into the complex protein choreography that underlies the crucial roles of mutagenic translesion synthesis in DNA damage tolerance, crosslink repair, and mutagenesis from environmental chemicals.",5,5R35ES028303-08,RFA-ES-16-008,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES,10,10,2,4

Most studies focus on the membrane protein (membrane protein) and the membrane insertion machinery with little consideration of how lipid environment affects transmembrane domain (transmembrane domain) organization. The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the role of lipid-protein interactions in the assembly, structure and function of membrane proteins. Using a combined molecular genetic and biochemical approach, we established that lipid dependent transmembrane domain orientation is dynamic (i.e., can reversibly change) during and after membrane protein assembly in vivo and is independent of other cellular factors in vitro. We proposed the Charge Balance Rule, which includes an acitve role for lipid environment, to explain the dynamic behavior of membrane proteins. We developed a library of lipid mutants of Escherichia coli in which lipid composition can be regulated during or temporally after membrane protein membrane insertion. The physiological significance of membrane lipid bilayer asymmetry is an understudied area. We now add to this library a set of E. coli strains and proteoliposome systems in which membrane lipid bilayer asymmetry can be controlled to determine the role of lipid bilayer asymmetry in membrane protein dynamic organization. Using this set of lipid reagents and native or engineered membrane proteins, we propose three integrated Specific Aims: Aim 1, We will quantify in thermodynamic terms and determine the mechanistic and structural principles underlying the molecular driving forces, as proposed by the Charge Balance Rule, that govern dynamic transmembrane domain topology organization as a function of membrane lipid composition and asymmetry. Aim 2, The role of CL in cell functions is not well understood. CL transbilayer asymmetry across any biological membrane is unknown, and there is still no reliable method for estimating its distribution across any membrane. E. coli lacking CL display several phenotypes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, which would seriously compromise growth in the wild. We will address the role of CL, its transmembrane asymmetry and the three CL synthases in supporting critical cell functions, which will be applicable to the understanding of the importance of CL and cls gene multiplicity in pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Aim 3, An essential membrane protein (FtsK) was identified by us associated with a late stage of cell division (a defect in phosphatidylethanolamine-lacking cells) that is topologically responsive to changes in lipid composition and phosphorylation of its extramembrane domains. We will address how changes in lipid composition/asymmetry and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles affect the function of FtsK as an example of a physiological function potentially governed by the Charge Balance Rule. By focusing on interfacial protein-lipid interactions in lipid bilayers with different lipid compositions and asymmetry, measuring electric forces acting on nascent membrane proteins during and after assembly, and characterizing physiologically important roles for CL (as we have for phosphatidylethanolamine), we will enhance our understanding of the forces that define membrane protein structure and function and the role membrane lipids play in cell processes.",5,5R01GM121493-07,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,7,2,0

Despite considerable experimental and computational advances with respect to defining and inferring protein-protein interactions (protein-protein interactions), no method currently exists to infer a hierarchy of protein interactions: that is, how proteins interact to create complexes, pathways, and phenotype. This proposal uses bacteria as a model to develop a novel statistical method that transforms a genome sequence into a hierarchy of protein interaction networks. Key to this approach is the advance that components of variation typically discarded as noise (harboring < 0.01% variance) in fact do contain biologically important information regarding protein-protein interactions. Preliminary results illustrate that our statistical method may be an effective multi-scale framework to describe emergent biological function arising from a 'parts-list' of proteins. We call our approach Spectral Correlation Analysis of Layered Evolutionary Signals (Spectral Correlation Analysis of Layered Evolutionary Signals); the main thrust of our proposal is testing the experimental validity and robustness of our approach. With respect to validity, we will combine high-throughput molecular genetics with computation to test whether Spectral Correlation Analysis of Layered Evolutionary Signals can accurately infer functions of uncharacterized proteins using P. aeruginosa as a model system. With respect to robustness, we will test whether our results are robust to the genomic feature used for measuring co-variation. Looking to the future of the laboratory, Spectral Correlation Analysis of Layered Evolutionary Signals may be generally useful for understanding hierarchical architectures across different biological systems, spanning proteins to cells to ecosystems. Therefore, we believe this proposal will serve as a critical launching point to explore important concepts central to the focus of the post-genomic era, namely creating novel mathematical frameworks by which to convert the torrent of highcontent, complex data being collected into useful and actionable biological knowledge. For defining the vision of the laboratory, natural systems are products of a generative process that is poorly understood-the evolutionary process. Though properly described as random variation and selection, evolution generates remarkably ordered, low-entropy biological systems that execute high-performance functions, are robust to perturbation, and have the capacity to adapt to new functions. It is therefore conceivable that quantitatively understanding design architectures of evolved systems, and how they come to be, may yield a new theoretical foundation of engineering for systems with natural-like properties; namely, the ability to dynamically interact with the environment. The broad vision of the Raman Lab is to elucidate organizational principles that govern the ability of evolved systems to work as well as maintain fitness. We hope to address this problem in a variety of systems subject to component variation and environmental selection. In doing so, our ultimate hope is to create rubrics for designing adaptive systems intelligently.",5,5R35GM146702-03,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

Chromosome-associated proteins are key factors in dynamically and accurately organizing chromosomes, and directly influence the replication, transcription, and translation of genetic information. As such, many diseases including various cancers are linked to malfunctioning of chromosome-associated proteins. In a majority of bacteria, ParABS partitioning system and structural maintenance of chromosomes (structural maintenance of chromosomes) protein complex are main contributors for chromosome segregation and organization. The ParABS system is composed of ATPase variant ParA, short palindromic DNA sequence parS, and parS-binding protein ParB. The parS sites are located in the vicinity of bacterial origin of replication. A longstanding conundrum in the chromosome biology field is that ParB proteins are not only found on the parS sites but also associate extensive (10-20 kb) flanking regions - a phenomenon termed spreading. It had been attributed to the ability of ParB protein to bridge different segments of DNA, that allows long-distance interactions. A new way of thinking derived from recent discoveries that ParB protein is not merely a DNA binding protein but also a novel cytidine triphosphatease enzyme. It was proposed that cytidine triphosphate (cytidine triphosphate) binding to the ParS and its subsequent hydrolysis cycle drives self-loading of ParS onto parS sites and subsequent sliding away from the loading sites. However, this ""clamp and sliding"" model alone has limitations in accounting for in vivo chromosome immunoprecipitation data. Another critical role of ParB proteins is that they recruit structural maintenance of chromosomes protein complex to the vicinity of the replication origin. However, little has been known about the structural maintenance of chromosomes protein recruitment mechanism. Once recruited, bacterial structural maintenance of chromosomes is thought to organize DNAs by actively extruding DNA loops. This simple mechanism that can explain many aspects of chromosome structuring is required to be demonstrated with bacterial structural maintenance of chromosomes complex. The PI has almost 15 years of single-molecule techniques expertise and his lab is devoted to elucidating the mechanisms of various DNA-binding proteins and their impacts on chromosome structure. During the next five years, the PI's laboratory will tackle the outstanding problems of underlying ParB and bacterial structural maintenance of chromosomes working mechanisms and their interplays utilizing his single-molecule approaches and newly acquired surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based expertise. Information one could extract from those proteins in traditional biology approaches is possibly averaged out due to the nature of simultaneous measurements of multiple proteins (ensemble measurements). Our approach will be expected to uncover hidden mechanisms with unprecedented details. The in vitro results will be corroborated by in vivo-based assays and theoretical modeling. The proposed work will pave the way for other future DNA-protein interaction studies. The long-term goal of the PI's research program is to elucidate how different DNA-binding proteins and their cofactors cooperate to maintain the genome stability and dynamics.",5,5R35GM143093-04,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,10,10,2,4

Though much has been learned using existing approaches, a major limitation in investigations of neural circuits has been the need to section the brain, destroying most of the network, and divorcing it from its sensory inputs or behavioral outputs. The mammalian circadian system, including the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (suprachiasmatic nucleus), is one such circuit, unique in that represents a well-defined population of cells that engage in a full suite of functions that typify an entire nervous system: the network is affected directly by sensory input which is easily manipulated, processes such input to alter its function, and generates outputs that directly impact behavior. The overall goal of our research program is to understand how the brain processes sensory light input, integrates that input into the ongoing circadian behavioral/regulatory program, and generates outputs that regulate behavior and physiological activity. We propose that it is a process involving hierarchical plasticity, where sensory neurons in the eyes affect the internal clock time of primary oscillator neurons, which then act on secondary and tertiary systems within the brain to alter global physiology and the timing of sleep/wake. With in vivo widefield fluorescence imaging using a miniaturized microscope, this circadian neural network can now be observed in real time during responses to environmental input, goal-directed behaviors, and abnormal function. This approach provides unprecedented anatomical and phenotypic specificity and can be applied over short (seconds-minutes) and long (weeks-months) timescales. Our research program comprehensively attacks a range of important systems-level features of circadian biology which were previously not addressable: cell-type specific acute response to systemic input (light), the on-going network level processing that occurs in response to that light input, and how those mechanisms begin to fail with aging. Such studies of hierarchical processing of sensory input, leading to systems-level plasticity and behavioral change, followed over long timescales will pay dividends in understanding the steady-state and aging mammalian nervous system as a whole.",5,5R35GM136661-05,PAR-17-094,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,0,1,5,1

To address this complex question, we study a relatively simple and experimentally trackable model organism, Myxococcus xanthus. Although a bacterium, M. xanthus exhibits many traits found in tissues and more complex multicellular species. One trait is multicellular development in response to starvation. Another trait, we discovered, is the ability of cells to distinguish between self and nonself for the exchange of cellular proteins and lipids. Recognition is mediated by a polymorphic cell surface receptor called TraA and its partner TraB. Only cells that bear identical or nearly identical TraA receptors engage by homotypic interactions. Social outcomes from this process, called outer membrane exchange (outer membrane exchange), vary depending on the properties of the interacting cells. In some cases, outer membrane exchange leads to cooperative interactions whereby healthy donors repair damaged cells by replenishing their cell components. In other cases, outer membrane exchange leads to antagonism when partnering cells are not clonal. Discrimination occurs by polymorphic toxin transfer to recipient cells that lack cognate immunity. Our future goals are multifaceted with respect to understanding outer membrane exchange and, more broadly, how cells recognize self and transition toward multicellularity. Over the next five years we will critically examine how outer membrane exchange leads to cooperativity. One area of investigation is how TraA/B directs emergent behaviors in populations that include synchronized and coordinated movements. This will be explored by monitoring global gene expression and how TraA/B interacts with a signal transduction pathway that controls motility. Cell synchronization is being studied with a biosensor the monitors' calcium fluxes in cells. Other approaches will probe how M. xanthus responds and adapts to environmental stresses, whereby those adaptations are transferred to naïve populations by outer membrane exchange. A second area of research addresses how myxobacteria rapidly diverge into different social groups in natural environments. Our preliminary findings indicate that horizontal gene transfer by non-lytic transducing particles mediate population divergence by carrying polymorphic genes involved in social discrimination. A third focus area will elucidate the mechanism of outer membrane exchange thought to involve outer membrane fusion. Finally, we will explore new mechanisms of selfrecognition and its role in multicellular life.",5,5R35GM140886-04,PAR-19-367,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,7,2,0

The majority of genetic variants associated with human diseases are located within non-coding genomic regions and may affect genome functions and phenotypes through modulating the activity of cisregulatory elements and cell-type specific gene regulatory networks (gene regulatory networks). However, our knowledge about the impact of genomic variants (alone or as combinations) on gene expression, GRN activity and ultimately cellular phenotypes are rather limited. Further, because transcription factors (transcription factors) and related cis-regulatory elements are known to have distinct functions based on cell-type and state, how genomic variants influence cell-type/state-specific activity of functional elements and phenotypes remains to be characterized in much greater details. This proposal aims to leverage a panel of multi-ethnic, gender-balanced human induced pluripotent stem cell (human induced pluripotent stem cell) lines (European, African American and African hunter gatherers) as well as recent advances in singlecell time-resolved or multi-omics technologies, predictive modeling of regulatory networks by machine learning and high throughput single-cell perturbation methods to study the functional impact of genomic variations on regulatory network, cellular phenotypes. First, we will establish a robust experimental framework of deploying advanced time-resolved and multi-omic single-cell technologies for detecting functional genetic variants at single-cell level. Next, we will develop novel computational methods for integration of single-cell data across different modalities and for accurate reconstruction and predictive modeling of gene regulatory networks driving cellular identify, developmental dynamics (cardiac and neural lineage cell fate transition). Finally, we will apply high-throughput combinatorial genetic or epigenetic perturbation approaches to modulate activity of key genes or putative cisregulatory elements at single-cell levels to improve our understanding of network level relationships among genomic variants and phenotypes.",5,5U01HG012047-04,RFA-HG-20-044,NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE,11,8,2,0

Unlike animals, plants neither have specific organs that see or hear various environmental stimuli nor can they move around to avoid adverse conditions. Although lacking a brain, plants can successfully integrate internal and external cues and make appropriate decisions about growth. In contrast to animals, growth in plants occurs post-embryonically, to produce new organs and for the growth and modification of existing forms to adapt to the local environment. Light is among the most relevant environmental signals because it not only drives photosynthesis but also provides critical information about the local growth environment as well as diurnal and seasonal timing. Over the next few years, my laboratory will aim to understand the molecular mechanisms by which a plant perceives and responds to its light environment. To address our questions, we will use cryptochromes (cryptochromes), the UV-A/blue light photoreceptors, as they form the interface between the light environment and the organism. cryptochromes are present in diverse organisms, including humans, where they regulate circadian rhythms and several physiological processes, like metabolism, growth, and magnetoreception. We will obtain mechanistic insights on how CRY regulates gene expression at the cellular level, which leads to morphological changes at the organismal level. We will also determine how light and the newly identified CRY2-associated molecules that we have discovered function in CRY-mediated signaling pathways. Also, our research will unravel the novel mechanisms by which cryptochromes, through their interaction with the RNA-binding proteins that we have discovered, control RNA metabolism, specifically that of methylated RNAs (m6A). m6A is an RNA modification that controls its fate as a reversible regulatory mark, and disruption of RNA methylation leads to growth defects in plants and is linked to several human diseases. We will also address how cryptochromes integrate environmental signals and modify chromatin through their interaction with chromatin remodelers, whose findings will fill a large void in this field. The success of this study will significantly improve crop productivity to feed the growing human population and aid in the development of optogenetic tools to target neuronal disorders. In humans, disruption of CRY activity is associated with many human disorders, including cancer, inflammation, insomnia, and diabetes. Understanding CRY function can lead to both prevention and treatment of these diseases.

Virus latency-in which the virus does not replicate independently of the host cell or produce active viral progeny-is required for long term viral escape from immune surveillance. This leads to prolonged persistence and chronic infection. Latency is well-defined for herpesviruses and retroviruses but not for other viruses such as Merkel cell polyomavirus (Merkel cell polyomavirus). This proposal seeks to investigate how Merkel cell polyomavirus controls its own replication to achieve persistence/latency with new technologies developed in our laboratory. The Merkel cell polyomavirus Large T (Large T) oncoprotein is a replication helicase needed for Merkel cell polyomavirus genome replication. Other Merkel cell polyomavirus viral factors including small T protein, miRNA, circRNA, as well as cellular elements (e.g. Skip-Cullen-F box (Skip-Cullen-F box) E3 ligases, Vam6p, USP7) regulate Merkel cell polyomavirus replication by changing Large T protein accumulation at the viral origin or by changing Large T functional activity. In Aim 1, we will characterize Large T binding and helicase activity by single molecule visualization of Large T protein binding to Merkel cell polyomavirus genome DNA using LUMICKS C-Trap. These studies will allow us to directly determine in situ Large T binding, multimerization kinetics, initiation of helicase activity, and, potentially, initiation of DNA synthesis. This allows us to separate molecular Large T binding to DNA from its transcriptional activities that feedback to regulate Large T. Non-origin Large T binding sites that may serve as transcription factor binding sites will also be investigated. Accessory factors regulating Large T-origin binding will be determined in subsequent aims. In Aim 2, we will extend our findings on proteostatic viral latency for Merkel cell polyomavirus using CRISPR-Cas9 library screening of 72 clonal cellular Skip-Cullen-F box (Skip-Cullen-F box) E3 ligase knockouts to search for novel Large T-E3 ligase interactors regulating Merkel cell polyomavirus replication by targeting Large T for degradation. Confirmation of these factors will be performed by gene knockout and mutation of putative Large T phosphodegron sites. In Aim 3, we will use live cell imaging of a novel Merkel cell polyomavirus fluorescent reporter virus in a single round replication system to monitor cellular factors, such as cell cycle stage using FUCCI stable cells, and viral factors found in Aims 1 and 2 to determine when and how these factors regulate viral replication at the single cell level. Completion of these aims will build a fundamental understanding on how a small DNA tumor virus regulates its own replication. These studies make use of new technologies applied by our laboratory to examine Merkel cell polyomavirus replication. Taken together, these aims will define whether a programmed Merkel cell polyomavirus latency lifecycle exists and, if so, how this lifecycle impacts virus persistence. These studies will have direct importance to the understanding of the genesis of Merkel cell carcinoma and may point toward targeted therapies to control persistent Merkel cell polyomavirus, as well as other polyomaviruses causing diseases among cancer and immune suppressed patients.",1,1R01AI177607-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

For many years, the cytoskeletal field has focused on the roles of microtubule-binding proteins and motors as the primary regulators of network structure and function. However, it is now clear that the -tubulin building blocks are not so simple. Rather than a uniform track, the microtubule surface is a molecularly diverse landscape that is generated by genetic and posttranslational differences between -tubulins. The `tubulin code' model posits that changes to the intrinsically disordered carboxy-terminal tail (carboxy-terminal tail) domains of -tubulins create a molecular code at the microtubule surface that is ""read"" by microtubule-binding proteins. The overarching goals of this proposal are to establish mechanistic connections between carboxy-terminal tails and the conformational diversity of microtubule ends and lattices, and to understand how this regulates complex microtubule network functions at the cellular level. This structure proposal features and function, and a multi-system, multi-scale approach to understanding how how these lead to changes in the function of microtubule networks carboxy-terminal tails impact tubulin in cells. My lab has established expertise in investigating tubulin using approaches that integrate genetic models, live-cell imaging and protein biochemistry. Our progress over the past five years has furthered our understanding of how - tubulin carboxy-terminal tails regulate microtubule networks, and, more broadly, how tubulin heterogeneity impacts cellular and developmental processes. The proposed project will build upon our expertise to expand the current model of the tubulin code and give broader insights into mechanisms of microtubule function. Our goals for the next five years include 1) define how carboxy-terminal tails guide the structure of microtubule ends to regulate microtubule dynamics, 2) determine how blends of -tubulins with different amino acid sequences and posttranslational modifications give rise to complex behaviors at the level of microtubule networks in cells, 3) define how carboxy-terminal tails promote the directionality of kinesin motility along microtubules, and 4) establish a novel role for tubulins in buffering intracellular cation concentrations. Our synergistic approach is uniquely suited to advance knowledge of tubulin structure and function that will be important in a broad range of contexts, provide new insights into how microtubule networks regulate and respond to changes at the level of tubulin subunits, and how these impact different cellular contexts.",5,5R35GM136253-05,PAR-17-094,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,7,2,0

We use two systems in Drosophila development to study cell size control that provide a natural system for uncoupling growth and division: embryogenesis and oogenesis. The early embryo is an extremely large cell that undergoes rapid divisions without cell growth, while the oocyte uses polyploid nurse cells to grow to a massive size without dividing. In the embryo, the final cell size is determined by the nucleus to cytoplasm ratio (nucleus to cytoplasm ratio). The nucleus to cytoplasm ratio controls a major developmental transition known as the mid-blastula transition (mid-blastula transition) where the cell cycle stops and zygotic transcription initiates. Recently, we discovered a surprising mechanism for N/C-ratio sensing in the pre-mid-blastula transition embryo. Hyper-abundant maternally provided histone H3 acts as a competitive inhibitor of the DNA-damage checkpoint kinase, Chk1, to prevent cell cycle slowing. As more and more nuclei are generated by the successive divisions the pool of ""free"" (ie-not chromatin-incorporated) H3 is imported into the increasing numbers of nuclei and then incorporated into chromatin thereby releasing Chk1 inhibition to allow cell cycle slowing once a threshold nucleus to cytoplasm ratio is reached. In oogenesis, polyploid nurse cells generate the maternal supply of materials required for the egg and ""dump"" their contents into the oocyte to achieve the correct volume. Histone biogenesis appears to play a role in regulating progression through oogenesis as well, though the molecular mechanism is unclear. Over the next five years, work in this R35 MIRA proposal will: 1) interrogate the molecular mechanisms by which maternally provided H3 contributes to cell size sensing at the mid-blastula transition; 2) understand how the nucleus to cytoplasm ratio affects nuclear and chromatin composition leading up to the mid-blastula transition; and 3) extend the lab's current models of cell size sensing to the growing egg chamber. These projects will further the long-term goal of understanding cell size and cell cycle control in a diverse array of tissue types and developmental timepoints. The resulting insights will expand our understanding of fundamental processes shared by most living cells but that are obscured in other model systems by the tight coupling between cell size and cell cycle progression.",5,5R35GM150853-02,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,10,10,2,0

Recent advances in light microscopy have enabled us to observe myosin 2 dynamics in living cells at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.

This proposal uses high-resolution imaging along with a toolbox of cellular and molecular assays to dissect the mechanisms by which cells build actomyosin 2 contractile structures, tune them to fit the cellular process, and deconstruct them.

Biomolecular condensates have emerged as a potential universal solution to how activities and functions are organized within cells. Condensates by nature are formed via collective interactions between biomolecules which together form concentrated assemblies. These collective biochemical interactions govern both condensate regulation and function within cells. The interface of the condensate with the cytosol (interfacial surface) has emerged as a critical molecular determinant for condensate regulation, and function. Biological Pickering agents absorb the interfacial surface of condensates and offer a versatile solution for how cellular functions can be compartmentalized. As interest in biomolecular condensates as an organizing principle in the cell has increased, so have the criticisms of the quality of evidence supporting the biological significance of condensates in native cells. To overcome these valid criticisms a key challenge moving forward for the field is the development of technical approaches to measure and manipulate the collective interactions within these assemblies in native cells. The molecular mechanics that underpin condensate regulation, dynamics, and function in native cells is not well understood. During C. elegans embryogenesis, RNA granules called P granules undergo a dramatic stereotyped polarization within the zygote. Using P granule as a model condensate this proposal aims to define the core biochemical principles that underpin the spatial and temporal regulation of P granule polarization. The goals of this proposal are to 1) identify key biochemical determinants that facilitate P granule assembly 2) define the molecular mechanism by which DYRK kinase regulate P granule disassembly 3) define the biochemical mechanism by P granule assembly and disassembly is spatially regulated 4) determine the biochemical mechanism by which biological Pickering agents are removed from the interfacial surface of P granule 5) define the molecular mechanics that underpin the kinetic arrest of P granules. To accomplish these goals, we will use a multifaceted approach that includes biochemistry, cell biology, and genetics.

Multicellular signaling networks, encoded in genetic networks, underlie the normal development of embryos and drive their morphogenesis. Paradigmatic example is the periodic segmentation of mesoderm into somites, the precursors of the vertebrae, during vertebrate development. Changes in genes, effector proteins, and cellular environments can lead to altered embryonic development as seen in congenital disorders. To cure diseases we need to understand how genes control cells at multiple scales and how groups of cells form coherent, functional tissues and organs. The last years have witnessed a boom in discoveries in developmental biology with single-cell sequencing, microfluidics, optics, increased computational power leading to unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution of the multiscale dynamics of morphogenetic systems, from molecules to cells to whole embryos. While these advancements have produced detailed roadmaps of the events orchestrated during development, we still lack a clear picture of which cellular networks drive collective morphogenetic programs. The classical forward and reverse genetic perturbative screenings, and even modern perturbative tools like optogenetics, still mainly focus at the level of the gene(s) or single signaling pathways. This makes it challenging to infer causal relationship between complex multicellular networks and developmental transitions. New perturbative tools are needed that could construct similar complexity as the ones observed in vivo. As these complex networks in vivo are based on cell-cell and cell-environment communication pathways, we need controllable versions of those pathways that we can (i) link in complex synthetic networks, (ii) use to control endogenous developmental pathways. Such a system would enable the introduction of precise and complex spatiotemporal perturbations at the level of the networks instead of the gene(s), ultimately delivering increased understanding of the relationship between complex networks and resulting developmental transitions. In our lab we develop synthetic cell-cell and cell-ECM pathways, connect them in networks, and use them to investigate developmental processes. Here we propose to (i) use these tools to investigate the mechanistic contribution of Notch signaling to the formation and propagation of signaling waves in the presomitic mesoderm and, (ii) develop new tools for cell-ECM communication, inspired by developmental signaling. We expect to enter a cycle of toolsàtestàanswersànew questionsànew tools.

Neural crest cells (Neural crest cells) are an excellent example of these developmental processes, initially forming at the neural plate border/dorsal neural tube, undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and migrating before differentiating. This represents an important problem, because defects in neural crest development underlie many human congenital birth defects including Treacher-Collins syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, and Hirschsprungs disease. We have determined that Neural crest cells extend cell projections that are enriched in specific RNAs. From these data, we hypothesize that localization of specific migratory mRNAs to NCC protrusions by zipcodes are required for directed migration. The rationale for the proposed studies is that an in-depth understanding of the cellular mechanisms of normal NCC migration will provide insights into the etiology of both neural crestassociated birth defects, including numerous syndromes, and cancer cell metastasis. We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that specific mRNAs are enriched in NCC protrusions and are required for NCC migratory behavior. In Aim 1, we will determine the transcriptome and proteome of NCC projections and test their function. 2) Test the hypothesis that zipcode sequences in NCC protrusion localized mRNAs are required for localization and NCC migration. In Aim 2, we will examine the localization and function of UTR regulatory sequences. Together, these studies will reveal the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which specific RNAs and proteins enriched in NCC projections promote NCC migration.

Current perspectives on the intergenerational transmission of substance use and disorder have been greatly influenced by longstanding socialization theories of parental modeling and problematic parenting. At the same time, substance use and disorder are heritable and substance using parents also pass genetic liability to use substances to their children. Identifying causal mechanisms of intergenerational transmission is critical to develop and implement effective preventive-intervention efforts, but observational studies of nuclear families and parent-child dyads fully confound socialization and genetic influences. Effects of parental substance use within families are particularly salient now, in the context of rapid shifts in marijuana legality, availability, and acceptability. We will examine the intergenerational impact of parental marijuana use using two complementary natural experiments - the children of twins design and a comparison of two states with markedly different marijuana laws - in 6,457 parents and adolescents from 1,902 families in Colorado and Minnesota. Twin parents are participants in the Colorado-Minnesota Marijuana Study (DA042755), a collaboration between two genetically informative, longitudinal twin studies with parallel, multi-wave, longitudinal measures that are conducted in two states with marked differences in current marijuana legality and availability. We now intend to recruit and twins' adolescent children, and nontwin parents/caregivers, to evaluate parent-child transmission of marijuana use and disorder.

Although many self-reactive conventional T (Tconv) cells are removed from the body by clonal deletion, considerable evidence demonstrates that this process is imperfect. The control of remaining self-reactive Tconv cells requires suppression by CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, which function throughout life to prevent autoimmunity. Efforts to define the mechanisms by which Treg cells suppress Tconv cells have revealed numerous potential mechanisms, including the masking of costimulatory ligands, the local production of suppressive cytokines, or the hoarding of key accessory factors. However, these antigen non-specific ""bystander"" mechanisms are not sufficient to explain self vs. non-self discrimination, especially in the context of innate immune activation during infection, highlighting the importance of new research examining the mechanisms of Treg-mediated suppression. Previously, we identified two self-peptides (""C4"" and ""F1"" peptides) that are recognized by naturally occurring Treg cell populations and are derived from a single prostate-specific protein, Tcaf3. Here, we demonstrate that selection on the C4 peptide during repertoire formation is critical for the prevention of prostatitis, and that polyclonal Treg cells of other specificities can not compensate for the shift in the C4-specific T cell pool. This reveals a key role for Treg-mediated suppression of Tconv cells of matched peptide/MHC-II (peptide/MHC-II) specificity, as opposed to broad antigen non-specific mechanisms. The objectives of this application are to elucidate mechanisms by which Treg cells coordinate peptide/MHC-II-specific immune suppression at steady state and during infection. We will achieve our objectives in close collaboration with Dr. Ron Germain, an expert in advanced imaging techniques, and Dr. Nancy Freitag, an expert in the genetics of the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Listeria monocytogenes). In Aim 1, we will use functional experiments and advanced confocal imaging to define the mechanistic basis of peptide/MHC-IIspecific Treg cell suppression at steady state, testing the hypothesis Treg cells do not prevent the initial activation of peptide/MHC-II-matched Tconv cells, but instead rheostatically respond to activated Tconv cells to restrict their subsequent differentiation and expansion. In Aim 2, we will define the role of Treg cell peptide/MHC-II specificity in coordinating self vs. non-self discrimination during Listeria monocytogenes infection, testing the hypothesis that robust peptide/MHC-II-specific suppression by self-selected Treg cells is imparted by both quantitative (numerical) advantages and qualitative properties induced by the recognition of peripheral self-ligand prior to infection. In all, our work is expected to elucidate key mechanisms by which the immune system orchestrates host defense while limiting collateral damage to self tissues.",5,5U01AI154560-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,3,4,1,3

Circadian photoperiod, the proportion of daylight in a solar day, is a pervasive environmental signal that varies substantially with latitude and season, and drives acute and long-term effects on mood regulation in humans and in animal models. The associations of the molecular circadian clock and photoperiod with mood disorders are clear, but the neurobiological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. The serotonergic dorsal raphe nuclei (dorsal raphe nuclei) are a critical nexus for integrating circadian photoperiodic input with mood and reward. They receive light input from the circadian visual system and polysynaptic input from the biological clock nuclei and make widespread outputs, including to midbrain nuclei mediating motivation and reward through dopaminergic transmission. Seasonal photoperiods (winter-like ""short days"" vs. summer-like ""long days"") induce enduring changes in mouse dorsal raphe nuclei serotonin neurons - programming their excitability and intrinsic electrical properties, their serotonin content, as well as anxiety and depressive-like behaviors. We have previously shown that the TREK-1 K+ channel mRNA expression is photoperiodically regulated in dorsal raphe nuclei 5HT neurons, and therefore may play a key role in photoperiodic programming of serotonin excitability. A number of independent lines of evidence indicate that TREK-1 in dorsal raphe nuclei neurons impact mood regulation and mood disorders. We now also report intriguing sex-dependent photoperiodic regulation of dopamine uptake and release downstream of the dorsal raphe nuclei in the NAc of female mice, indicating photoperiodic impact on circuitry for motivation and reward that mirrors the reported female bias of Seasonal Affective Disorder (Seasonal Affective Disorder) in humans. We propose as our overall hypothesis that dorsal raphe nuclei 5-HT neurons are a primary site of photoperiodic programing - in which transcriptional regulation of TREK-1 plays a key role in regulating neuronal excitability. In congruence with the NIMH RDOC paradigm, we envision photoperiod programing as an extended circuit for positive valence system behaviors in which the output of the programmed serotonergic dorsal raphe nuclei induces convergent drive by the dorsal raphe nuclei and VTA inputs to alter NAc function, driving changes in the output of reinforcement/motivated behaviors. We will further elucidate a mechanistic basis of photoperiodic programming of 5-HT neurons involving TREK-1, and downstream effects of this programming on positive valence systems, including NAc dopamine release and uptake, NAc synaptic plasticity, and NAc-driven motivation behavior. Completion of these Aims will enhance understanding of key neurobiological mechanisms underlying photoperiodic regulation of mood, motivation, and reinforcement.",5,5R01MH130537-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,5,1

Defects in a single tissue can affect the formation of an entire organ and a classic example of this is the eye, where disruptions in retinal histogenesis can cause microphthalmia, a severe ocular anomaly characterized by small, poorly formed eyes and congenital blindness. Mutations in the Visual System Homeobox 2 (Visual System Homeobox 2) gene cause microphthalmia. A definitive marker of retinal specification, Visual System Homeobox 2 functions in retinal progenitor cells to define tissue identity. Concurrently, Visual System Homeobox 2 is required for progenitor proliferation and several aspects of the neurogenic program including the timing of neurogenesis onset (neurogenic timing), and the fate specification of bipolar cells. Two gaps in our understanding are the mechanistic interconnectedness of the progenitor properties regulated by Visual System Homeobox 2 and whether progenitors change in how they utilize Visual System Homeobox 2 over the course of histogenesis. To address these gaps, we generated two new Visual System Homeobox 2 alleles in mice, one with a knock-in reporter/knock-out configuration and the other for conditional gene inactivation. In the first two aims, we will characterize the retinal phenotypes of these mutant alleles and determine how they compare to phenotypes caused by a natural null allele and two missense alleles that correspond to disease-causing mutations in humans. Conditional gene inactivation will be done with tamoxifen-inducible Cre/lox recombination to determine the temporal windows of Visual System Homeobox 2 utilization in progenitors and test the hypothesis that Visual System Homeobox 2's control of retinal identity, neurogenic timing, and proliferation are separable. We also predict that additional roles in the balanced production of cells in each retinal cell class (neurogenic output) will be unmasked by temporal inactivation after the start of neurogenesis. In the third aim, we test the hypothesis that retinal identity control shifts from a Visual System Homeobox 2-dependent to independent state that is epigenetically defined for some of the earlier targets. In the fourth aim, we will incorporate an ex vivo culture paradigm to test candidate genes identified in the previous aims for their functional significance in promoting or interfering with retinal development. Completion of these studies will provide new insights into how Visual System Homeobox 2 orchestrates retinal progenitor properties and how retinal progenitors drive retinal histogenesis, an essential component of eye organogenesis.",5,5R01EY013760-17,PA-20-185,NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE,18,13,9,1

Sensation is an active process in which the detection and initial encoding of sensory information is dynamically modulated by sampling behavior. Understanding how central circuits process sensory information in the context of active sampling is critical for understanding the neural basis of sensation in the behaving animal. The goals of this project are to understand how neural circuits in the mammalian olfactory bulb transform sensory inputs in vivo and in the context of active odor sampling, or sniffing. First, we will examine circuit-level determinants of the diverse patterns of excitatory drive onto mitral and tufted cells, focusing on the respective roles of sensory inputs and glomerular circuits in generating this diversity. Second, we will define if and how stimulus features themselves - in particular, odorant chemistry and intensity - relate to the dynamics of excitatory drive onto MT cells, as well as how these dynamics are shaped by sniffing behavior. Finally, we will ask how dynamics and glomerular patterns of excitatory input impact the input-output transformation of the olfactory bulb. The proposed experiments implement several innovative approaches to dissecting circuit function in the intact olfactory bulb; these include using second-generation optical reporters of glutamate to directly image excitatory signaling onto mitral/tufted cells with high temporal resolution, dual-color imaging of glutamate and calcium to simultaneously monitor presynaptic inputs and readouts of mitral/tufted cell activity from the same glomerulus, and the use of identified glomeruli with well-characterized response spectra to design powerful tests of model predictions. The overall impact of the project will be to advance a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between the dynamics of odor sampling and the resulting dynamics of neural activity in the olfactory bulb. These findings will pave the way for ultimately understanding the role that neural dynamics and active sampling play in odor perception.",5,5R01DC019636-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,0,1,5,1

Cherenkov Excited Luminescence Metabolic Sensing (Cherenkov Excited Luminescence Metabolic Sensing) was developed to probe small molecule molecular tracers of pertinent tissue function in vivo, to take advantage of the highly developed linear accelerator x-ray sources for high-resolution molecular sensing in small animals. Cherenkov Excited Luminescence Metabolic Sensing can be used to image through 3 cm of tissue, preserving the exquisite molecular sensitivity of optical luminescence at M-nM concentrations in vivo, while achieving millimeter level spatial sampling. This combination of ultra-high molecular sensitivity, combined with deep penetrance and spatial sampling is far better than any comparable small animal modality possible today. The thin sheets of x-rays used are shaped by multi-leaf collimators and are swept over the tissue to localize the excitation volumes of Cherenkov in vivo, allowing precise knowledge of where the detected light came from. Time-resolved emission can be captured with time-gated intensified sensors for luminescence lifetime data, that we are advancing. We also advance probes for lifetime sensing of oxygen partial pressure (pO2) and tissue acidity (pH). Cherenkov Excited Luminescence Metabolic Sensing achieves similar benefits to light-sheet fluorescence microscopy but can image through the whole body of a rat. While the diffuse optical luminescence still has to exit the body, reconstruction-based recovery can improve the localization through iterative image reconstruction, achieved with full knowledge of where the excitation beam was within the body. Most importantly, high energy x-rays are less absorbed than lower kVp x-rays, and so this can be achieved with a radiation dose as low as a CT scan. The design can implicitly allow longitudinal temporal sampling or spatial heterogeneity histogram sampling. Advanced non-toxic biocompatible probes have been uniquely developed for this application, that do not require toxicity associated with heavy metals or nanoparticles. To advance the technology for translation to other medical centers, we identify low-cost approaches that can work with any linear accelerator, through innovations in hardware, open-source software, and suitable metabolic probes. In the hardware advancement we invent a new sensor approach to maximize capture of every possible photon per linear accelerator pulse, thereby minimizing dose required. The techniques can be distributed with a linear accelerator treatment plan that is completed with a delivered dose less than a diagnostic CT scan, <10 mGy. In the probes, a new version of bright-emitting, biocompatible, implanted oxygen sensors will be advanced with high potential for daily measurement in the same locations. Taken together this project will provide the tool for a fundamentally new low-cost way to image metabolic signatures of tissue that could be widely available in any academic medical center, with superior image resolution, deeper tissue penetration, and better linearity of response than is possible today.",1,1R01EB033877-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING,17,8,2,0

Knowledge on how the cell biology of synapses is established and altered in the actuation of memories is of critical importance in our aspiration to understand how the building blocks of the nervous system come together to produce its functional output, behaviors. The key scientific premise of my research program is that our understanding of how complex behaviors emanate from the molecular building blocks of synapses could be meaningfully expanded by simultaneously interrogating structure-function relationships across scales, bridging knowledge on the molecular composition of individual synapses within single cells, the organization of single cells within circuits, and the coordinated activity of circuits within the brain of behaving animals. Achieving this integrated view is a challenge of critical importance best summarized in the BRAIN Working Group Report to the NIH Director, and requires new approaches that allow the integration of knowledge across 1) spatial scales, from the subcellular architecture of the synapse to the cellular architecture of the circuits governing behaviors, and 2) temporal scales, from the events leading to synaptic assembly during development, to the events leading to synaptic plasticity during learned behaviors. To address this challenge, my lab established strategic collaborations with network scientists, microscopists and computational biologists and pioneered integrated approaches that enable unprecedented access to the cell biology of the synapse in the thermotaxis circuit of C. elegans. Using these approaches we discovered concepts that reframed how we understand the cell biology of the synapse in vivo, and now position us to address three fundamental questions in neuroscience: 1) How is synaptic specificity achieved during the development of the nerve ring neuropil? 2) How are changing metabolic needs met at synapses to sustain function? 3) How are synapses modified to form memories and underpin behaviors? We propose to answer these questions for the thermotaxis circuit to define fundamental mechanisms that govern how synapses are precisely assembled, maintained, and modified to sustain behavior. Importantly, the resulting integrated understanding across scales will yield new concepts regarding the interplay between the programs that robustly establish synaptic architecture during development, and the plasticity programs that govern synaptic change to facilitate behavior. We anticipate, because of the molecular conservation of the examined pathways, that advancements in our understanding based on these innovations will result in transposable lessons of broad biological significance.",5,5R35NS132156-02,RFA-NS-22-038,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,13,5,1

These gene clusters are widespread in genomes across species. They account for 22% and 18% of annotated genes in mice and humans, respectively. A gene family usually contains multiple gene clusters located on different chromosomes. Therefore, studying the regulation of gene clusters adds a new layer on top of traditional transcriptional regulation. Studies on the Keratin, Hox, Globin, Olfactory-Receptor, and other gene clusters revealed distinct epigenetic and topological states that contribute to differential transcriptional outcomes. The knowledge gaps in the field are: (i) missing detailed mechanistic machinery that constitutes specific epigenetic and topological domains on a gene cluster, (ii) is there general interchromosomal crosstalk of multiplex gene clusters in the same gene family, and (iii) what protein modules spatially organize gene clusters in the cell nucleus and facilitate their coordination. The proposed research seeks to decompose (a) epigenetic principles of gene clusters with distinct expression patterns, (b) molecular mechanisms that configure intraand inter-cluster conformations, and (c) protein cascades that organize gene clusters within sub-nuclear structures. We will utilize the multiplex Keratin gene clusters as a paradigm in the biological context of avian skin development. Since gene clusters are widespread in genomes and used in novel development and organ morphogenesis, misexpression or mutation of clustered genes contributes to abnormal development and diseases. The proposed research will provide a fundamental understanding of complex gene regulation.

Working memory and timing are two computational features that evolved to allow the brain to use recent information about the past to accomplish short-term goals. Working memory refers to the ability to transiently store information in a flexible manner, while timing refers to the ability to generate well timed motor responses, modulate attention in time, and predict when external events will occur. To date working memory and timing have primarily been treated as independent processes. Here we propose that because the brain seeks to use information about the past to predict the future, that working memory and timing are often multiplexed. Specifically, that the neural patterns of activity recorded during the delay period of many working memory tasks encodes both retrospective information about the past, as well as prospective predictions about the future. To test this hypothesis, we have developed novel variant of the delayednonmatch-to-sample task, in which the first cue predicts the duration of the delay, that is, how long an item must be held in working memory. This task will allow us to determine if network level population responses encode both retrospective information about the past and prospective information about delay duration. Preliminary results from a supervised recurrent neural network model predict that the temporal structure of the neural patterns of activity elicited by both cues will be different. This prediction will be tested using large scale Ca2+-imaging to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of activity in brain areas associated with working memory and timing. Additionally, optogenetic perturbation experiments and longitudinal characterization of the emergence of neural patterns of activity will be performed. These experiments, will in turn, be used to ground computational studies aimed at understanding the neuronal and circuit level learning rules that underlie the emergence of patterns that encode working memory and time.",5,5R01NS116589-03,RFA-NS-18-030,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

Populationand sex-specific differences in CMD predisposition exist; however, the biological mechanisms underlying these differences are not well understood. Previous large-scale genome-wide association studies (genome-wide association studies) have reliably identified CMD-associated variants in multiple populations; however, functional understanding of the biological mechanisms of the genome-wide association studies variants remains challenging. One major obstacle is the limited knowledge of the relevant cell types in which genome-wide association studies variants affect gene expression. Bulk tissue gene expression data exist for CMD-relevant tissues, such as subcutaneous adipose, but these data exhibit considerable heterogeneity, including both cell type and cell state within each cell type. Subcutaneous adipose is an important human endocrine tissue for cardiometabolic disorders, and it is possible to collect high-quality adipose tissue samples from healthy individuals. However, the contributions of many adipose genes to cardiometabolic disorders and CMD traits are still poorly understood. The current lack of cell-type expression reference data sets limits fine-scale regional transcriptional assessment of genome-wide association studies variant effects. In addition, local expression quantitative trait locus (ciseQTL) analyses are confounded by cell-type-specific expression differences, which hamper replication efforts across independent bulk RNA-sequenceduenced (RNA-sequenced) cohorts. To address these knowledge gaps and identify genetic effects on adipose cell-type gene expression, we will perform single nucleus RNA-sequenceduencing (single nucleus RNA-sequencing) in frozen subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy samples from 300 well-characterized individuals, generate fine-scale estimates of cell-type proportions, identify study-wide and personalized cell-type-specific differences corresponding to cardiometabolic trait levels, and experimentally test genome-wide association studies variants for allelic effects on celltype-specific expression. We hypothesize that by elucidating adipose tissue cell-type expression from 300 existing frozen adipose biopsies, we can leverage available genome-wide association studies and adipose bulk RNA-sequenced data (n=3,230; 45% female) from diverse populations to identify the relevant cell types for hundreds of CMD genes. In our preliminary studies, we have successfully performed snRNA-sequenced in frozen human subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies and performed multi-omic studies integrating genome-wide association studies results with bulk adipose RNA-sequenced data, identifying hundreds of colocalized loci for CMD traits. Our approach will leverage the existing wealth of information available in genome-wide association studies and bulk adipose RNA-sequenced cohorts to elucidate the largely unknown cell types of biological mechanisms in the adipose tissue that drive cardiometabolic disorders.

A process known as cochlear amplification (cochlear amplification), now the subject of intense work around the world, has critical components not yet studied. Two questions of broad interest that this proposal address are; 1) how does the fundamental hydrodynamic viscosity contribute to the unique frequency analysis capacity of the cochlear apex where speech frequencies are processed and 2) does the tectorial membrane in have a central and biochemical role in regulating the calcium ion concentration that is so critical to hair cell function. There are three Aims. New and innovative experimental approaches are needed to address these questions. For the measurement of output variables, we continue to use the optical coherence tomography (optical coherence tomography) method, that we pioneered, to record inner ear tissue vibration. We use state of the art confocal imaging methods applied to whole organ explant systems and measure calcium ion concentrations in quiescent and stimulated inner ears. In Aim 1, about question 1, we also propose to determine if perilymph macroscopic viscosity is a crucial parameter of apical frequency tuning. As well as whether the tuning is dependent upon the process of cochlear amplification within the traveling wave as it propagates to the apex. To manipulate viscosity, normal perilymph is replaced with altered viscosity perilymph via a real time perfusion system. Aims 2 and 3 are about question 2 where we seek to understand how and with what consequence is calcium stored by the tectorial membrane. Involved is the use of mutant mural models of defective tectorial membrane structural proteins and quantitative fluorescent determination of calcium concentrations in endolymph and tectorial membrane. Additionally, in Aim 3, we explore how age might factor into the tectorial membrane calcium sequestration via two models that manipulate the physiology of the stria vascularis a known target of age degeneration. Model 1 is the chronic application of furosemide, an agent to suppress endocochlear potential. Model 2 is the genetically targeted chemical alteration of stria vascularis blood flow).

Unfortunately, longevity also increased the healthcare burden due to comorbidities of aging such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease). Overwhelming evidence indicates that hyperlipidemia is a main driver of cardiovascular disease, which promotes an inflammatory response by vasculature-resident macrophages. Other inflammatory cells, chiefly among them T-cells, are also recruited to growing plaques and play a fundamental role in their remodeling and susceptibility to rupture. In women, it is well recognized that loss of ovarian hormones at menopause is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. Current therapies, such as statins, lower circulating LDLcholesterol and have been clinically demonstrated to decrease mortality in the elderly. Yet, despite the use of statins for over five decades, atherosclerosis still remains the leading cause of death in men and women globally. These observations indicate that 1) there are additional, yet unidentified, lipid-independent mechanisms that contribute to atheroprogression and plaque rupture; and 2) additional therapies are needed to treat AScardiovascular disease. Unpublished preliminary data from our laboratories in mice show that aging in both sexes and loss of estrogen in females promotes T-cell mediated inflammation. We hypothesize that this ageand menopause-dependent inflammation exacerbates underlying cardiovascular disease such that further lowering cholesterol does not provide added benefit. Here we will test the idea that promoting an anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving environment in the plaque is atheroprotective. To accomplish this, we will use treat mice with pulsed low-dose RANKL (pulsed low-dose RANKL), which we show induces plaque resident regulatory CD8+FoxP3+CD25+CTLA4+ T-cells that secrete IL-10. If successful, pulsed low-dose RANKL will be a novel therapeutic for treating AScardiovascular disease, that works by mechanism distinct from therapies currently in use. Additionally, the proposed studies will deliver two key innovations. First, we will compare atheromata in young (2-month-old) and old (18-month-old at beginning of intervention, corresponding to ~60-year-old human) male and female mice. Second, old females will be ovariectomized to mimic human menopause. Thus, in females we will segregate the effects of aging and menopause on plaque development. We will comprehensively map athero-prone proximal aorta transcriptomic profiles at a single-cell resolution, focusing on inflammatory cell clusters, cell-to-cell communication networks, T-cell-mediated dysfunction of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, markers linked to plaque stability/vulnerability, and transcripts encoding predicted secreted proteins (secretome). The integrated mechanistic data obtained with our unprecedented discovery approach will have a lasting impact in the field of vascular physiology and pathology because most published murine atherosclerosis studies have systematically ignored the effects of age, sex, and hormonal status, despite most cardiovascular disease patients being older (and post-menopausal).

While extremely valuable for disease detection, biomarker positivity does not correspond to level of cognitive functioning in preclinical Alzheimer's disease, nor does it provide prognostic information about the timeline for future cognitive and clinical decline. There is a critical need for inexpensive and easily administered methods of detecting and staging Alzheimer's disease as it runs its course from the preclinical to symptomatic stages. Novel neurocognitive tasks that yield early behavioral markers of Alzheimer's disease pathology could fill this critical need. A cognitive ""stress test"" that could serve as a harbinger of impending decline among Alzheimer's disease biomarker-positive individuals would be a significant contribution to the field. The proposed project will determine the diagnostic and prognostic utility of two innovative neurocognitive tasks - Visual Sensory Binding (Visual Sensory Binding) and Visual Short Term Memory Binding (Visual Short Term Memory Binding) - as novel cognitive markers of Alzheimer's disease pathology during the preclinical and prodromal stages of the disease. Impairment of Visual Sensory Binding and Visual Short Term Memory Binding has previously been shown to be sensitive and specific for dementia and mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Visual Sensory Binding and Visual Short Term Memory Binding are not impacted by normal aging, depression, or non-Alzheimer's disease dementias, hence these tasks have great potential as cognitive markers to detect and stage early Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. To further evaluate the clinical utility of these novel tasks, they will be administered to participants from the UC San Diego Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Alzheimer's diseaseRC) diagnosed as cognitively normal (cognitively normal) or with mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment). Data from the Alzheimer's diseaseRC Clinical Core (clinical ratings, neuropsychological test results, APOE genotype, and CSF biomarker levels) will be used in tandem with the study-specific tasks to achieve the Aims.

Prior work, funded by a K99/R00, found that on-demand optogenetic manipulation of the cerebellar cortex was able to robustly inhibit hippocampal seizures in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, with the greatest benefits occurring through modulation of the midline cerebellum (vermis). Key areas of investigation arise from this prior work: 1) Does this observed functional connectivity extend to healthy, non-epileptic animals? What regions and cell-types in the hippocampus are impacted by cerebellar modulation, and what pathways mediates the observed functional connectivity? 2) How does cerebellar-directed intervention lead to seizure inhibition? Specifically, what form of modulation is required of the cerebellar nuclei? What pathways ultimately mediates successful seizure inhibition? 3) How can we make this information (that optogenetic cerebellar modulation can inhibit temporal lobe seizures) more directly translatable? Specifically, can electrical stimulation of the cerebellum be done in such a way as to also robustly inhibit seizures? What stimulation parameters are critical for success? Can electrical stimulation be successful when targeted to the cerebellar cortex? To the nuclei? Does the timing (i.e. on-demand) of intervention matter? Can we improve outcomes through cerebellar targeted interventions? Answering these questions improve translatability of previous findings and opens the door to novel intervention strategies. We find that cerebellar modulation of the hippocampus is not limited to seizure suppression, and somewhat surprisingly, preliminary data indicates that there is a preferential impact on the CA1 region, including an increase in activity of inhibitory interneurons. Additional preliminary data suggests that optogenetic excitation, but not inhibition, of the fastigial nucleus provides seizure control. This allows us to explore further downstream, including fastigial inputs to the central lateral nucleus of the thalamus, tracing the functional connectivity pathway. Importantly, we are also finding that electrical, rather than optical, intervention targeting the cerebellar cortex is able to inhibit seizures, but, as hypothesized, that the stimulation parameters used are critical for success. Successful identification of appropriate parameters is achievable through Bayesian Parameter Optimization, which allows a rational, data driven, closed-loop approach to parameter exploration. Taken together, the proposed experiments will provide important insight not only into cerebellarhippocampal interactions, but also thereby networks capable of seizure suppression, and how to effectively target those networks using the clinically available tool of electrical stimulation.",5,5R01NS112518-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

Tau is normally a microtubule (MT)-associated protein that appears to provide stability to MTs in axons, and excessive phosphorylation of tau in tauopathies promotes its disengagement from MTs and misfolding into oligomeric and fibrillar structures. This results in increased MT dynamicity, reduced MT density and altered axonal transport in transgenic (transgenic) mouse tauopathy models, with evidence of similar MT deficits in Alzheimer's disease brain that likely contribute to neurodegeneration. We previously demonstrated that administration of the brain-penetrant MTstabilizing natural product, epothilone D (epothilone D), to transgenic tauopathy mice resulted in dramatic improvements in several key endpoints, including increased MT density, reduced axonal dystrophy, diminished tau pathology and a lowering of neuron loss with improved cognitive performance. Although epothilone D progressed to a small Phase 1b clinical trial in Alzheimer's disease patients, its future clinical advancement is uncertain. Thus, there would be considerable value in identifying alternative MTstabilizing agents that could undergo more thorough testing in Alzheimer's disease and tauopathy patients. Towards this end, we evaluated additional MT-stabilizing compounds from different classes, with the goal of identifying alternative and potentially improved candidates for development as disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. This effort led to the identification of a preferred subset of brainpenetrant MT-stabilizing triazolopyrimidines (triazolopyrimidines) that compared to epothilone D and other MT-stabilizing natural products, offer notable advantages, including oral bioavailability and easier synthesis. With NIH/NIA support (U01/AG061173), a systematic exploration of the structure-activity relationships of triazolopyrimidines ultimately led to the identification of a structurally novel compound (CNDR-51997) that exhibits improved MT-stabilizing activity and pharmacokinetic profile. Based on extensive characterization of this compound, including efficacy testing in two different Alzheimer's disease mouse models, we believe that CNDR51997 qualifies as a candidate compound for further development. Accordingly, the primary objectives of this three-year, late-stage U01 proposal are to develop CNDR-51997 through IND-enabling studies and submit an IND application.",1,1U01AG088051-01,PAR-22-047,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,2,6,6,1

In healthcare, racial bias could arise due to systematic biases in classification and coding, data availability, or data accuracies that differ across racial groups. For instance, algorithms that use data on healthcare costs-rather than illness-to predict need tend to allocate too few resources to Black patients who are underserved by our current system and generate lower spending than white patients with the same health conditions. This issue is increasingly relevant because most U.S. public health insurance programs operate capitated managed care systems, in which beneficiaries enroll in private insurance plans, and the government pays insurers a fixed monthly capitation payment per enrollee. These per-capita payments are typically calculated using risk-adjustment algorithms, in which patient costs are predicted with information on age, gender, and selected health conditions from data on past enrollees. However, race is often excluded from these algorithms, raising the possibility that risk-adjusted managed care could widen racial disparities in care and outcomes among patients. Yet there is little empirical evidence on the impacts of risk-adjusted managed care systems on racial differences in care and health outcomes, especially in high-cost settings, such as long-term care. This project will advance knowledge on these issues by studying the causal effects of risk-adjusted managed long-term care (managed long-term care) on racial disparities in care and outcomes among dual-eligible Medicare/Medicaid long-term care beneficiaries in New York, using 8 years of administrative data on Medicaid and Medicare enrollment, claims, and assessment records. The project will identify the effects of risk-adjusted managed long-term care on a range of care utilization and health outcomes, including inpatient, post-acute, nursing home, and at-home care, prescription drug use, and mortality, separately by patient race/ethnicity. Leveraging the county-by-county rollout of managed care mandates, the analysis will use difference-in-differences models to compare within-county changes in outcomes of patients in New York from before to after managed care was implemented. We will estimate separate models by race/ethnicity of the patient, testing for statistical differences in managed long-term care effects. The project will also identify subgroups who are most severely affected by racial bias in risk-adjustment algorithms, through sub-group analyses that compare effects by gender, age, presence of chronic conditions, and zip code level median income. The project will additionally examine the role of managed care plan features in driving racial disparities in health care utilization and health outcomes. Results will help policymakers, healthcare organizations, providers, and patients to understand the implications of bias in risk-adjustment algorithms on patient health, identify subgroups of patients who are most severely impacted, and learn about effective plan features that could curb or eliminate racial health disparities in managed care settings.",5,5R01AG077949-03,RFA-MD-21-004,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,1,3,3,2

LncRNAs have been proposed to regulate all cancer hallmarks, but, in the vast majority of cases, their molecular mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap is a major impediment towards realizing the potential of long noncoding RNAs as therapeutic targets in cancer and other diseases. As in many human malignancies, long noncoding RNAs are frequently dysregulated in renal cell carcinoma (renal cell carcinoma). renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer and the most lethal malignant urological tumor, with approximately 70,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States. To date, most genomic studies of renal cell carcinoma (and other cancers) have focused on identifying disease-associated alterations of protein-coding genes. Our understanding of the molecular pathways regulated by long noncoding RNAs in renal cell carcinoma, and the functional roles of these transcripts in this malignancy, remains limited. We mined RNA-seq data from renal cell carcinoma patients to identify a set of 805 long noncoding RNAs that are commonly overexpressed in this tumor type. We generated a custom CRISPR interference (CRISPR interference) library targeting these long noncoding RNAs and performed screens in multiple renal cell carcinoma cell lines to identify long noncoding RNAs that are essential for renal cell carcinoma cell proliferation. These experiments revealed that the lncRNA Colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (Colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed) is required for growth of all tested renal cell carcinoma cell lines. Although this lncRNA has been shown to be overexpressed and is associated with poor patient survival in renal cell carcinoma and other types of cancer, its molecular function remains unclear. We identified a critical region of Colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed that is necessary for renal cell carcinoma cell proliferation and we identified proteins that interact with this sequence. We also generated novel genetically-engineered alleles in mice that enable constitutional or conditional deletion of critical Crnde sequences. In this proposal, we will leverage our new understanding of this lncRNA, and the novel resources we have generated, in order to dissect the molecular function of Colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed and define its role in normal physiology and in renal cell carcinoma pathogenesis in vivo. These experiments will take advantage of our extensive experience, and that of our collaborators, in evaluating noncoding RNA functions and renal cell carcinoma biology using cellular and animal models. Successful completion of the proposed research will address two major knowledge gaps in the fields of RNA biology and cancer biology: 1) our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms-of-action of long noncoding RNAs; and 2) how these mechanisms are co-opted by cancer cells to promote tumor growth, particularly in renal cell carcinoma. We anticipate that the principles revealed by these studies will be broadly applicable to our understanding of the roles of other long noncoding RNAs in cancer cells and may set the stage for developing therapeutics that target Colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed or the pathways it controls.",5,5R01CA282036-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,10,2,0

Ovarian hormone deficiency induces a gut microbiota-dependent shift in effector T cell populations (e.g., T helper 17 [Th17] and T regulatory [TREG] cells) within the gut and bone marrow that disrupt bone homeostasis and lead to bone loss. Although the gut microbiota is recognized for playing a critical role in this osteoimmunological response, little is known about the signaling of gut resident dendritic cells that translates these local effects into systemic T cell responses. Prebiotics such as oligosaccharides serve as substrates for microorganisms residing within the gut. Fermentation of oligosaccharides by gut microbiota yields metabolites that favorably affect intestinal epithelial cells lining the mucosa and immune cells within the gut lymphoid tissues. The investigation of the mechanisms of prebiotic-induced immune and bone responses has been met with experimental challenges, namely those encountered when studying the interactions between multiple physiological systems. In this R21 project, we propose to study the dendritic cell-mediated bone and T cell responses to estrogen deficiency and to B-galactooligosaccharides (B-galactooligosaccharides) prebiotic dietary invention in the periphery (bone and blood) and locally in the gut using a combination of in silico mathematical models and in vivo animal models. The mathematical model we will develop will focus on the interacting systems modulated by B-galactooligosaccharides and by estrogen through T cells and dendritic cells. The model will use differential equations to track immune cells, cytokines, hormones, and metabolites in the gut and peripheral blood and bone compartments. The model will build from our literature-informed preliminary model of the interactions in the gut-bone axis in response to dietary intervention and will be refined by comparison to the experimental data collected in the study, specifically adding the roles of dendritic cells, estrogen, and different T cell populations. In addition to protein analysis of the cytokines and metabolites obtained from in vivo studies, we will use computational deconvolution methods to infer cell type-specific transcriptional profiles from heterogeneous samples. The transcriptomics data is intended to provide more comprehensive immune response information than flow cytometry alone and to be exploratory of cellular interactions excluded from the preliminary computational model, e.g., dendritic cells. This project is designed to provide key data about the dendritic cell and T cell immune responses stimulated by dietary B-galactooligosaccharides supplementation in both intact and ovarian hormone deficient animal models. Successful completion of this project will yield a predictive mathematical model that can be used as a tool to explain possible mechanisms for how local gut stimuli and immune responses interact to yield peripheral phenotype changes, to inform the design of future experiments, and to identify critical control points within the gut-bone axis for designing and optimizing treatment strategies.",5,5R21AG077640-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,3,4,1,3

This proposal reflects on an ongoing research program in our laboratory that has focused on the role of growth factors in memory formation. The primary focus of this current project is to examine GF-mediated memory formation from a novel perspective, which takes into account the temporal aspect of their activity as part of the cellular computation involved in forming memories. Repeated-trial learning, a fundamental form of memory acquisition exhibited by virtually all animals, including man, requires a temporal interaction between an ongoing stimulus and the delayed effects of a previous stimulus. We will use a powerful paradigm to study repeated-trial training in the marine mollusk Aplysia, which develops long-term memory (long-term memory) for sensitization after only two training trials, but only if they are separated by a permissive and surprisingly specific time interval of ~45 min. This minimal system clearly separates the initiating stimulus (Trial 1) from the repeated stimulus (Trial 2), providing unparalleled access to the temporal interactions underlying repeated-trial long-term memory. We will investigate two GF-dependent mechanisms that our preliminary evidence suggests contribute significantly to temporal processing at the heart of repeated-trial learning. The first (explored in AIM 1) is a distributed mechanism for GF-dependent phosphorylation of extracellularly regulated kinase (extracellularly regulated kinase). The second mechanism (explored in AIM 2) is the multi-step signaling of a specific GF, TGFβ, which we propose similarly integrates the timing of training trials. Finally, in AIM 3 we will try to establish causal connections between the timing of single extracellularly regulated kinase phosphorylation, TGFβ availability, and the persistent effects of two-trial training The project holds promise for significant impact from both a basic scientific perspective and a clinical perspective. From a basic scientific perspective, Aplysia provides an exceptional experimental system that has the potential to demonstrate causal linkages between GF-mediated memory formation and its underlying synaptic and molecular mechanisms, while simultaneously exploring the temporal features of those mechanisms. And from a clinical perspective, the impact of this project addresses a major challenge in mental health: to understand and treat the devastating cognitive disorders that accompany neurodegenerative diseases. GF signaling has been directly implicated in many of these diseases and, since growth factors are extracellular proteins, understanding when and where they act in the brain during memory formation could provide novel strategies for developing more specific and more effective therapeutic agents.",5,5R01MH120300-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,5,1

In model systems, metformin prolongs lifespan, and observational studies in humans similarly suggest a longevity benefit for patients who take metformin. In spite of recent progress in the biology of metformin action, the mechanisms by which metformin exacts favorable effects on longevity and aging remain incompletely characterized. Our recent work provides evidence that metformin targets multiple, fundamental aspects of the aging process. In particular, we have shown that metformin-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial energetics restrains transport through the nuclear pore complex (nuclear pore complex). Restrained nuclear pore complex transport locks the pro-aging kinase mTORC1 in the inactive state. It is known that many cells obtain a ""leaky"" nucleus as they age, and our work is the first suggestion that metformin can target this leakiness through action on mitochondria. Our preliminary data and published studies indicate that metformin can also target mitochondrial leakiness that is mechanistically linked to aging. These exciting observations suggest that metformin is positioned to reverse multiple, pathological cellular changes that occur with aging. In doing so, the drug is poised to fulfill the geroscience principle: by reversing fundamental aspects of the aging process, metformin may target not one but many aging-associated diseases simultaneously. In spite of this tantalizing possibility, critical gaps in our knowledge remain that prevent us from fully realizing the therapeutic potential of metformin. In which tissues is metformin action needed to promote longevity? How are metformin effects at mitochondria transduced to effectors that mediate the drug's geroprotective effects? What is the full spectrum of molecular events required for metformin effects in aging? The overall objective of this application is to determine the sites and mechanisms of metformin action in aging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that metformin promotes healthy aging by targeting mitochondrial energetics in specific tissues, which signals through downstream effector pathways to promote longevity. The rationale for this work is that completion of the project will illuminate both specific effector sites of the drug and unexpected elements of the metformin response pathway. In Aim 1 we will define mechanisms by which metformin targets mitochondria to promote longevity. Aim 2 will characterize mechanisms by which metformin reduces mitochondrial permeability in aging. In Aim 3, we will probe a larger landscape of metformin response genes in order to understand the full spectrum of metformin's direct and indirect cellular effects in aging. This project is significant because it will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which biguanides mediate their positive effects on lifespan. We put forth conceptual and technical innovations that will allow discovery of the most important aspects of the response to metformin. Successful completion of this project will pave the way for a new generation of strategies that can promote healthy aging and reduce the onset and severity of aging-related diseases.",5,5R01AG069677-05,RFA-AG-20-044,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,12,2,0,0

Historically, caregiving research has been focused on the psychosocial and physical health and wellbeing of the individual primary caregiver and has generally overlooked the social contexts in which caregiving occurs, such as the role of interactions among multiple caregivers. Our recent study to evaluate the scope and potential impact of informal caregiving networks for persons with dementia (persons with dementia) using an egocentric social network approach, i.e., one based on the informant's perspective, has revealed that there are complex group dynamics and allocation of care activities, including financial obligation, among multiple members of the network. We also learned that the outcomes of caregivers (e.g., financial hardship) and persons with dementia (e.g., hospital admissions) may be offset by network characteristics and dynamics. The social network approach is well aligned with the phenomenon of informal caregiving for persons with dementia as it accounts for group dynamics of a social network and helps explain how such network characteristics affect members' behaviors and well-being. However, for widespread use of caregiving network assessment in both research and practice settings, a reliable and easy-to-use assessment tool will be necessary, but no such tools currently exist. In response to RFA AG-23-002, we propose to develop CareNet, an interactive digital tool with an embedded interview/survey, that will be easily deployed by providers and researchers to fully characterize a persons with dementia's caregiving network. We will employ an iterative user-centered design approach, involving key stakeholders (i.e., caregivers, healthcare and social service providers, and researchers) to optimize design and content considerations. In Phase 1, we will conduct interviews with diverse informal caregivers to assess their needs and views about the meaning of caregiving from multiple perspectives, which will inform adaptation of our egocentric caregiving network survey to better reflect the pluralistic culture of caregiving. In Phase 2, we will conduct a series of usability evaluation sessions with the key stakeholder participants followed by pilot-testing in a controlled, observational setting. Finally, in Phase 3, we will field-test CareNet to evaluate usability and acceptability in field settings in which providers and researchers interact with a caregiver to collect caregiving network data. We will refine features and functionality in anticipation of large-scale testing of utility and future applications in practice settings. Our final, fully functional CareNet will promote systematic caregiving network assessment by providers in practice and wide use of social network analysis for characterizing informal caregiving of persons with dementia by future investigators to expand the empirical knowledge of informal caregiving.",5,5R56AG083167-02,RFA-AG-23-022,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,1,3,3,2

Neural dedifferentiation has been associated with many of the behavioral impairments typically observed in healthy aging, and evidence collected by our group during the original funding period has found a strong relationship between neural dedifferentiation and gamma-aminobutyric acid (gamma-aminobutyric acid), the brain's major inhibitory neurotransmitter. Specifically, we found that gamma-aminobutyric acid levels are lower in older vs. younger adults and that older adults with less gamma-aminobutyric acid exhibit greater dedifferentiation. We propose to take this line of research in two new directions.  We will conduct a longitudinal study and explore age-related trajectories of change in gamma-aminobutyric acid, neural distinctiveness, and behavior, as well as directional relationships among these measures (e.g., Do gamma-aminobutyric acid levels at age 65 predict subsequent declines in neural distinctiveness? Does neural distinctiveness at age 65 predict behavioral declines over the next decade).  We will also examine how dedifferentiation is related to Alzheimer's pathology by collecting the same measures in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment in whom amyloid beta and tau burden has already been measured. The proposed studies will provide novel insights into how the brain changes with age and with neuropathology, whether those changes can explain the observed behavioral deficits, and whether changes in gamma-aminobutyric acid levels are a contributing cause. Such insights could lead to novel interventions to alleviate the behavioral impairments associated with healthy and pathological aging.",5,5R01AG050523-09,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,2,6,6,1

However, the underlying neurobiological pathophysiological changes in the brain that contribute to these declines are still largely unclear. The objective of this proposal is to investigate neural mechanisms of age-related attentional distractibility, focusing on the neural circuit initiated from the locus coeruleus (locus coeruleus). In the current proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the neural dysconnectivity of locus coeruleus with the salience network (salience network) drives failures of ignoring distractors in older adults. To this end, we will examine humans' and animals' brains simultaneously through 1) an integrative approach combining human brain imaging and animal-based neural circuit manipulation and 2) equivalent research designs, including compatible attention task paradigms, analogous neural network analyses, and rescue strategies between human and animal. Using our novel unidirectional circuit-specific gene manipulation approach in vitro and in vivo, we will directly impair and rescue the locus coeruleus-salience network circuit in animals and examine how the circuit manipulation changes attention performance in the presence of distractors in the animal model. For human older adults, we will examine how locus coeruleus-salience network connectivity is associated with selective attention performance, and how improved locus coeruleus-salience network connectivity through a cognitive training program may lead to improved attentional performance. To increase fidelity in locus coeruleus signal estimation, we will utilize two advanced imaging approaches at both the structural and functional level, namely neuromelanin-weighted structural MRI and physio-noise correction. Finally, we will include a measure of family history of Alzheimer's disease (first degree relative) as variable of potential interest for exploratory analyses.

However, bromodomain and extra-terminal domain inhibitors induce Rac1-mediated activation of MNK kinases, which mediate mRNA translation. Importantly, targeting MNK kinases and the MNK effector hnRNPA1 enhances the efficacy of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain inhibitors. Significantly, MNK inhibitors induce CD8+ T cell infiltration, but their effector function is suppressed by the tumor-associated macrophages (tumor-associated macrophages). Notably, bromodomain and extra-terminal domain inhibitors can decrease the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages. The objective in this application is to elucidate the mechanisms by which the combination of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain and MNK inhibitors demonstrates anti-tumor responses against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The central hypothesis is that the combination effectively targets the cancer cells, modulates the tumor immune microenvironment, and normalizes the pancreatic stroma to suppress pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma growth. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) Define and target negative feedback loops to enhance the anti-tumor effects of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain inhibitors in vivo; 2) Evaluate the effects of the combination of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain and MNK inhibitors on CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation; 3) Determine the effects of the combination of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain and MNK inhibitors on the pancreatic stroma. Under the first aim, the mechanisms by which MNK effectors hnRNPA1 and CYFIP1, which can function downstream of Rac1, limit the efficacy of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain inhibitors will be evaluated. Further, the efficacy of co-treatment with bromodomain and extra-terminal domain and MNK inhibitors will be evaluated in organoid and transgenic mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. For the second aim, the effects of the combination therapy on CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation and macrophage abundance and polarization will be evaluated. In addition, the contribution of MNK kinases and the MNK effectors hnRNPA1 and CYFIP1 in macrophages to limiting the efficacy of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain inhibitors will be evaluated. In the third aim, the effects of the combination therapy on the stromal reaction will be characterized in the transgenic mouse model. The contribution of MNK kinases, CYFIP1, and hnRNPA1 in pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts to limiting the efficacy of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain inhibitors will also be evaluated. In addition, the relationship between bromodomain and extra-terminal domain and MNK kinase activity, MNK effectors, and stromal reaction will be evaluated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumor specimens. There are several innovative elements in this proposal, including the novel therapeutic approach to enhance anti-tumor responses in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients; novel concepts on how the combination therapy of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain and MNK inhibitors modulates the tumor immune microenvironment and the stromal reaction for synergistic anti-tumor responses; and the unique combination of complex models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, including in vivo orthotopic, organoid, and transgenic mouse models.

This medical ableism likely contributes to the substantial health disparities experienced by people with disabilities. However, public health research to date has not evaluated the frequency and variety of medical ableism experiences among patients with disabilities, nor has it measured how these experiences adversely affect the care and health of disabled patients. The long-term goal of our research is to develop a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of medical ableism that will ultimately allow us to develop targeted interventions to mitigate its effects on the care and health of people with disabilities. The objective of this observational study is to conduct quantitative analyses of the medical ableism phenomenon and its impact on the healthcare and health outcomes of people with disabilities. This research will move the field beyond abstract assessments of internal ableism among providers by providing detailed evidence about how people with disabilities experience medical ableism. The specific aims of the project are: 1) to create and field survey modules measuring medical ableism and its adverse care and health impacts, 2) to characterize experiences of medical ableism, and 3) to identify the adverse care and health impacts of medical ableism. These aims will be met using a large, diverse, and well-established survey developed by the research team: the National Survey on Disability and Health (NSHD).

Conversely, research indicates that insecure attachment is an important risk factor for the development of both childhood behavior problems and physiological dysregulation (e.g., Luijk et al., 2010; see Fearon et al., 2010, and Groh et al., 2012, for metaanalytic findings). Thus, efforts to prevent insecure attachment are crucial for children's healthy development. Although a few promising approaches to preventing insecure attachment, physiological dysregulation, and childhood behavior problems have emerged (see Berlin et al., 2016), none has achieved widespread implementation. What is urgently needed is evaluation of a comprehensive theoryand research-based intervention protocol that can be widely implemented among families whose children are at elevated risk for developing or maintaining insecure attachments, physiological dysregulation, and behavior problems. The goal of the proposed study is to conduct an RCT of the Circle of Security - Parenting (Circle of Security - Parenting) intervention within Early Head Start (Early Head Start) programs, in light of evidence that Early Head Start children and families are characterized by factors (e.g., low income, parental depression, exposure to violence/trauma; USDHHS, 2006a) that leave them at increased risk for insecure attachment and behavior problems. The project addresses the NICHD CDBB priority of promoting psychosocial adjustment for at-risk children and of understanding contributors to positive outcomes that can occur despite high-risk environments. Moreover, the project addresses a critical barrier to progress in the attempt to reduce the risk of negative outcomes among at-risk children by testing the efficacy of an intervention that was designed in collaboration with families and staff from the real-world contexts in which it will be implemented. Principal aims are to examine whether the addition of this brief attachment-based intervention to regular Early Head Start services will  reduce child insecure attachment, physiological dysregulation, and behavior problems; and  promote sensitive parental responses to child distress. Additional aims are  to examine potential moderators of intervention effectiveness and  to test whether changes in parental response to child distress act as a mechanism of positive change. We have chosen HS/Early Head Start as a strong service delivery mechanism because it is a widely available resource in many communities, with an infrastructure and a commitment to the mental health of children. The HS/Early Head Start program has shown positive outcomes in some areas, yet evidence of reducing the risk of insecure attachment is lacking (Spieker et al., 2005).

Because single economic security policies rarely fill all economic gaps, most low-income families do not use economic security policies in isolation, but rather ""package"" them to make ends meet. While the effects of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the minimum wage have been studied extensively, there have been few studies of Unemployment Insurance and no identified studies of the combined effects of these four economic security policies. This study builds on existing research that demonstrates positive overall effects of individual ESP generosity on birth outcomes among the low-income population and differential effects based on social statuses. The study also draws from research showing that more generous economic security policies improve correlates of maternal-fetal health. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a nationally representative, longitudinal data set, this study will examine how individual economic security policies and ESP combinations compare to one another in terms of the size of their effects on low birth weight and preterm birth. Additionally, this study will be the first to determine the relative contribution of four potential mediators explaining the link between ESP generosity and birth outcomes (i.e., healthcare access, food insecurity, psychological distress, and prenatal health behaviors). Lastly, this study will identify whether the effects of ESP generosity is moderated by poverty level, race, marital status, and education. As the US social safety net has shifted to one that rewards labor market participation, economic security policies have become a more familiar feature of working poor households. These households-low-income, but workingaccount for the majority of poverty in the US and their ranks are likely to grow in the wake of the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. This suggests a pressing need for information on which policies generate the greatest returns, how they influence birth outcomes, and for whom they are most effective. As such, this research will contribute significantly to scientific and policy efforts to reduce rates of low birth weight and preterm birth among low-income women and reduce inequalities in birth outcomes.",5,5R01HD107077-02,PA-20-185,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,1,5,3,2

Yet, ethical report-back of research results (report-back of research results) is context-specific, requiring consideration of the people and data in a particular study. New adaptations are needed, for example, to align report-back ethics with the emerging science of the exposome, defined as the totality of social and environmental factors across the life cycle. Exposome studies generate hundreds of measurements from many techniques, including geospatial assessments of neighborhood stressors, biomonitoring for multiple classes of chemicals, and indicators of health-related effects at the cellular level. Importantly, because exposome studies evaluate the joint effects of chemical mixtures and social stressors, they are wellpositioned to support participants who are grappling with exposures in a context of environmental and social injustice, underlining the value of report-back of research results to promote equity. To support ethical practices in exposome-focused studies, this project will address a key challenge - report-back methods have yet to be tested for large numbers of measures across multiple domains. This project will develop innovative participant-centered methods for personalized report-back of research results for multi-level data in large studies and evaluate these methods in two diverse cohorts recruited during pregnancy: Chemicals in Our Bodies (CIOB, at the University of California, San Francisco and Berkeley) and Illinois Kids Development Study (IKIDS, at the University of Illinois). It will build on the well-tested capabilities of the Digital Exposure Report-Back Interface (Digital Exposure Report-Back Interface) to generate high-quality personalized reports for smartphone, computer, and print in studies of any size. Aim 1. Use participatory methods to develop ethical guidance for personalized report-back of research results for multi-level data, including large chemical biomonitoring panels, geospatial socio-environmental indicators, and early effect biomarkers. This aim will bring together input from participants, researchers, and bioethicists, first to focus on CIOB/IKIDS and then to broaden input and discussion to other studies. Aim 2. Enhance the value of report-back of research results for participants by developing digital tools that support participants' ability to take action and offer them scalable social support. Drawing on theories of health behavior, a new Digital Exposure Report-Back Interface feature will offer opportunities for participants to identify sources of harmful chemicals that are relevant for them and commit to individual and social actions to reduce exposures. Participants will be invited to a social media group. Aim 3. Develop, deploy, and assess personalized report-back of research results for diverse types of data in CIOB/IKIDS. New contextual information will be developed for Digital Exposure Report-Back Interface to help participants interpret new data types, and updated design will distill results across multiple domains. We will randomize half of participants to test the new Digital Exposure Report-Back Interface take-action feature. Outcome assessments include follow-up surveys and in-depth interviews about experiences and environmental health literacy as well as digital analytics to assess participants' engagement with their reports.",1,1R01ES036234-01,RFA-ES-23-006,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES,1,12,3,2

Because sleep hygiene is tightly linked to health, racial inequalities in sleep deficiencies may be a key determinant of racial inequalities in health. Racial inequalities in work-related stress may be a key, but understudied driver of sleep inequalities and ultimately, health inequalities. As with all racial groups, the majority of Black men and women are in the labor force; however, compared to White adults, Black adults spend more time in the workplace, are more likely to hold multiple jobs - and twice as likely to hold two full-time jobs. Further compared to White adults, Black adults tend to be in occupations that are objectively more stressful, where they have less control and greater physical and emotional demands, and to report greater levels of stress at work. While work-related stress has been linked to sleep deficiencies, there is a need to examine more racially-salient forms of stress such as vigilance, or the thoughts and behaviors in which Black Americans may engage in order to navigate everyday spaces such as the workplace. A substantial qualitative literature indicates that Black adults regularly anticipate and worry about potential encounters in everyday life such as being followed in stores or having assumptions made about their intellect or character. Vigilance may be particularly important for sleep inequalities because it captures a racially-salient and prevalent for of stress with characteristics that interfere with sleep quality and duration, including: (a) anticipatory stress, which predicts increased biological stress even in the absence of a stressful event; and (b) ruminative stress, which can transform acute situations into chronic sources of stress. Using both real-world and laboratory settings, we propose to collect data from 500 Black men and women to capture both momentary work-related stressful experiences and chronic work-related stress. We propose to examine the linkages between racially-salient, work-related stress, captured through ecological momentary assessments (ecological momentary assessments), and sleep deficiencies, captured through self-report and actigraphy. The workplace is particularly relevant for racial inequalities in health due to focus on economic upward mobility among Black Americans and the growth of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives that may widen inequalities due to the need for vigilance as Black workers join predominantly White workplaces.",5,5R01MD016244-03,PAR-20-164,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES,1,3,3,2
10930094,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/j0Tygmvs3kirfBj0cex_SA/project-details/10930094#similar-Projects,Measurement and Mechanisms of Pain in Autistic Adults,"A growing literature suggests autistic adults feel pain in a different manner than non-autistic adults and may experience more persistent pain than the general population. As pain is often the first sign of injury or illness, individual differences in pain perception or communication can significantly impact diagnosis and treatment of many health conditions. Alternatively, when pain is not addressed, this can lead to a pro-nociceptive pain profile, where endogenous systems facilitate pain instead of inhibiting it, potentially contributing to persistent pain. Autistic adults often experience sensitivity in other sensory domains that could extend to pain. For example, hyper-responsiveness can include pain-like reactions to everyday tactile stimuli like tags on clothing. At this point, several studies have demonstrated increased pain sensitivity2,3, increased pain-related anxiety2, and altered neural responses to pain1 in autistic individuals. Yet, several important questions remain that present barriers to improving pain treatment in autistic individuals. In this project, we propose to address several gaps in our current understanding, building a framework to investigate pain sensitivity in autism. First, we will address pain assessment and expression of pain in autistic adults. Currently, there is no consensus recommendation on pain assessment in autism. It is not clear if autistic individuals express pain in specific ways that differ from nonautistic individuals and if better pain assessment tools would improve pain management. In Aim 1, we propose to test different pain scales in self-reporting autistic adults to determine reliability. Additionally, we will assess how pain ratings on these scales correspond to observable pain behaviors. Secondly, we will address potential factors that may predict persistent pain in autism. It is currently unknown if hypersensitivity to pain extends from a general sensory hypersensitivity for autistic adults. In Aim 2, we will explore individual profiles of sensory reactivity to identify important relationships between pain and sensitivity in other sensory domains. We will also explore relationships with social and emotional factors that may impact persistent pain. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will address potential brain mechanisms of pain sensitivity in autistic adults. Our previous work indicated that autistic adults have a different neural response to heat pain across somatosensory and affective brain regions, but the functional connectivity of these regions and the relationship between neural responses and pain reports is not clear. Overall, we hypothesize that autistic adults have difficulty communicating their pain, leaving them at a greater risk for mismanagement of pain. Additionally, we hypothesize that autistic adults likely have a pronociceptive profile increasing the magnitude of pain. This combination of difficult pain communication and a pronociceptive profile leaves autistic individuals at risk for persistent pain and is a detriment to their overall health. At the conclusion of this project, our work could inform how clinicians assess pain in autism (Aim 1), identify autistic individuals at most risk for persistent pain (Aim 2) and spark new mechanisms to improve pain management in autistic adults (Aim 3).",5,5R01NS133354-02,PA-21-201,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

Epithelial cells are emerged as an integrally important arm of innate defenses in the oral mucosa, while recent observations suggest that these cells can be exploited as privileged growth niches and a reservoir by P. gingivalis, which can intracellularly multiply and remain largely unharmed in gingival epithelial cells. Despite, extensive systems level molecular knowledge exists on the P. gingivalis and GEC interaction, there is considerably little known on the intracellular life of the organism in this central cell type. We recently revealed that formation of autophagosomes is critical for the P. gingivalis' intracellular replication and evasion of the anti-microbial degradation pathways in the gingival epithelial cells. Our novel preliminary findings also support that lipidation of LC3-C, a key molecule in the `selective autophagy' pathway, which targets intracellular pathogens is significantly modulated by P. gingivalis under the control of an anti-stress molecule, HSP27. Further, glutathione peroxidase (GpX1), a major host redox balance enzyme and a regulator of autophagic flux largely impacted on the global LC3 lipidation state of gingival epithelial cells upon infection. The inhibition of either HSP27 or GpX1 appears to severely affect the intracellular trafficking and viability of the microorganism. The central hypothesis is that P. gingivalis induces a distinct form of selective autophagy, which results in protection of bacterial life and ultimately securing of P. gingivalis' persistence in the oral mucosa. To test this novel hypothesis, we will pursue two-pronged approach, where we propose the selective autophagy requires tightly coordinated actions of HSP27 and GpX1 to form autophagosomes that fully function as protected replicative niches for P. gingivalis. Aim 1 will define the selective molecular machinery that drives P. gingivalis-containing autophagosome assembly under the control of HSP27 and the mechanisms that disrupt autophagic flux for the evasion of cellular degradation pathways. Aim 2 will establish the role of GpX1 in regulating the selective autophagy in infection via redox homeostasis and suppressing autophagolysosomal machinery. Both aims will employ reductionist primary gingival epithelial cells culture systems to functionally dissect out the mechanisms and phenotypically characterize the molecular events and sub-cellular components. Aim 3 will establish the dual significance of these two components using oral epithelial-tissue-specific knockout mice models. Thus, this proposal aims to fill a significant gap in our fundamental knowledge that is how P. gingivalis, a facultatively intracellular pathogen, establishes a privileged cellular environment and converts nutritionally rich epithelial cells into potentially a central reservoir for bacterial growth and persistence in the oral mucosa. Ultimately, the knowledge gained may translate into molecular strategies that can control or reduce the intracellular colonization and survival methods employed by this important opportunistic pathogen.",5,5R01DE030313-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH,7,9,1,3

Most of these models do not include adaptive behavioral effects describing how risk perceptions and fatigue influence engagement with social distancing and transmission reduction. Decisions on mask-wearing, levels of social contact, and vaccination will define whether the epidemic is controlled or enters annual circulation. We propose the development of population-based (PBM) and agent-based (ABM) transmission models to study the interplay between individual behavior and transmission dynamics, while considering the many uncertainties which still surround the virus, such as seasonal effects and the loss of immunity. Additionally, our models will be used to study how COVID-19 and seasonal influenza and respective behaviors interact, exacerbate outcomes, and potentially overwhelm the health care system. These models will build upon our prior research. Since Fall 2016 we have conducted regular longitudinal surveys investigating attitudes towards, risk perceptions of, and propensity to vaccinate for seasonal influenza. The ABM models constructed from these data account for adaption and memory of past experiences, peer effects, and population heterogeneity. Using machine learning methods, we have augmented a synthetic network representative of a small US city with this behavioral data. We have continued to conduct modified versions of these surveys to track how these beliefs translate to COVID-19. In parallel, we have developed a compartmental population-based model of COVID-19, which models transmission and the effects of NPI intensity and timing on both health and economic outcomes. We propose to extend our current compartmental PBM and build a new individual-level ABM, informed by longitudinal surveys. We will conduct a four-year longitudinal panel survey to construct an empirical behavioral model for decisions to socially distance, engage in transmission reduction measures (such as mask-wearing), and vaccinate. This information will be combined with our existing synthetic network data-set to enable us to build an individual level ABM of the spread of COVID-19 in a representative US city, integrated with our influenza ABM. This model will capture both how individual behaviors impact macro-level disease transmission and how influenza and COVID-19 could interact. Insights and data from our individual-level model will be used to inform and parameterize adaptive behavior within our compartment-level model, allowing for policy comparisons across a range of US states. In addition, we will consider which policies are robust to key behavioral and technological uncertainties, such as the extent of behavior change in response to perceived risk and the timing and effectiveness of vaccines. Finally, we will develop web-based interactive tools that allow for the exploration and comparison of different policies in a variety of potential futures.",5,5R01AI160240-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,1,12,3,2

Mechanisms how maternal exposures lead to asthma in offspring are unknown. To address this, we developed a mouse model, inducing asthma susceptibility in young mice by exposing their mothers to diesel exhaust particles (diesel exhaust particles). We then discovered that asthma in this model was driven in part by natural killer (natural killer) cells. This finding was surprising because it did not fit into the traditional paradigm of natural killer cells serving as a body's defense instrument designed to KILL. Our new data indicate, that instead, natural killer cells are part of a homeostatic response to REPAIR (NOT kill) fetal tissues that are metabolically-impaired by diesel exhaust, and that metabolic impairment is the primordial cause of asthma predisposition in our model. Metabolic impairment of diesel exhaust particles pups manifests itself in their reduced weight. The body's first response to growth-limiting insults is induction of pro-survival factors. Accordingly, hematopoietic tissues of diesel exhaust particles fetuses and pups over-produce growth arrest-specific protein 6 (growth arrest-specific protein 6), a cytokine known to be induced under conditions of reduced metabolism and impaired growth to protect tissues from death and promote their repair. Tissue repair has long been linked to type-2 immune responses. Consistent with this, injections of growth arrest-specific protein 6 promote type-2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) activation and asthma in normal pups. We hypothesize that growth arrest-specific protein 6 effects are at least in part due to induction of a type-2 program in developing natural killer cells, and that this program endows natural killer cells with a capacity to orchestrate responses of type-2 lymphocytes. growth arrest-specific protein 6 is a recognized enhancer of natural killer cell development. It is also a known activator of STAT6, a transcriptional factor linked to type-2 differentiation. Accordingly, natural killer cell development is enhanced in diesel exhaust particles offspring and their mature natural killer cells produce the type-2 cytokine IL13. We further show that in diesel exhaust particles pups, natural killer cells drive production of epithelial IL25 and activation of ILC2 and Th2 cells. In addition to producing IL13, diesel exhaust particles natural killer cells have enhanced ability to degranulate. We propose that these two traits underlie the unique capacity of diesel exhaust particles natural killer cells to activate type-2 immunity. We show that the granule protease granzyme B (granzyme B) potently synergizes with IL13 to induce IL25 from airway epithelial cells. Our overarching hypothesis is that maternal exposure to diesel exhaust particles promotes asthma susceptibility in offspring by impairing their metabolism and growth; this provokes a repair response, part of which is induction of growth arrest-specific protein 6 that programs natural killer cells for enhanced secretion of IL13 and granzyme B, leading to production of IL25 and activation of ILC2 and Th2 cells. In Aim 1, we will study natural killer cell-driven mechanisms of prenatally-programmed asthma, focusing on natural killer cell mediators (granzyme B and IL13) and IL25. In Aim 2, we will study importance of growth arrest-specific protein 6 in natural killer cell programming and transmission of asthma susceptibility. In Aim 3, we will use human blood samples to test a hypothesis that over-activation of the growth arrest-specific protein 6 pathway in natural killer cells in early childhood is a predictor of future asthma.",5,5R01HL122995-10,PA-18-484,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",3,4,1,3

How maternal exposures lead to asthma in offspring is unknown. To address this, we developed a mouse model of asthma susceptibility in pups by exposing their mothers to diesel exhaust particles (diesel exhaust particles). Our data suggests that in this diesel exhaust particles-driven model, asthma-predisposing information is transmitted in part by a subset of offspring long-term hematopoietic stem cells (long-term hematopoietic stem cells), in the form of a stem cell memory. This subset distinguishes itself by expression of the IL3 receptor and is programmed for enhanced generation of basophils by the synergistic action of diesel exhaust particles-induced IL1b and IL3. One key mechanism of the synergism between IL1b and IL3 is the ability of IL1b to increase stem cell sensitivity to IL3 which is in part due to IL1b-mediated upregulation of IL3R b chain. In addition to expanding the basophil lineage, IL3 and IL1b are likely to enhance its capacity to promote asthma. Previous studies show that IL1b potentiates basophil histamine release and IL3 potently stimulates their IL4 production, sowing the seed for type-2 immune response. Consistent with this, in diesel exhaust particles offspring, basophils overexpress IL4. The IL3/IL1b-primed, expanded, IL4-overexpressing basophil population becomes a key driver of the type2 immune response and asthma upon allergen challenge. Basophil depletion in diesel exhaust particles pups prevents generation of allergen-specific IgE and development of asthma. This is in contrast with data obtained in plain allergenbased models in which basophils are redundant for production of IgE and asthma. Our overarching hypothesis is that maternal exposure to diesel exhaust particles induces asthma susceptibility in offspring through IL1b and IL3 driven programming of the hematopoietic stem cell-basophil axis. In Aim 1, by performing stem cell transplantation experiments, we will establish links between diesel exhaust particles IL3R+ long-term hematopoietic stem cells, increased basopoiesis and predisposition to asthma. We will define molecular basis of diesel exhaust particles IL3R+ LT-HSC programming by analyzing their transcriptomes (RNA-seq) and chromatin remodeling at gene regulatory sites (analyzing their transcriptomes (RNA-seq) and chromatin remodeling at gene regulatory sites). In Aim 2 we will study importance of IL1b and IL3 in programming of the HSC-basophil axis for asthma induction. In our model, IL1b and IL3 are increased in offspring and maternal tissues, including maternal serum. We propose that maternal IL1b and IL3 are important at early stages of embryonic hematopoiesis, when HSCs undergo their initial divisions and embryonic sources of IL1b and IL3 are scarce. Offspring-derived IL1b and IL3 complete the HSC programming process, sustain basopoiesis at a high level, and contribute to basophil activation after maternal cytokines fade away. To define how maternal IL1b and IL3 are transferred to embryos, study their roles and roles of offspringencoded IL1b and IL3, we will perform serum transfers, injections with radiolabeled cytokines, and combine IL1b or IL3 KO strategies with embryo transfers. In Aim 3 we will use human blood samples to study IL1b and IL3 guided basophil development in childhood asthma.",5,5R01AI143837-04,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,3,4,1,3

Despite contemporary durable mechanical support of the heart, left ventricular assist device recipients continue to demonstrate low levels of physical activity and functional capacity, characterized by daily steps and six-minute walk test (6MWT) distance, even 1-year after surgery. In addition, left ventricular assist device recipients frequently meet criteria for prefrailty/frailty and associated sarcopenia, including low muscle strength and muscle quantity. These deficits may contribute to increased healthcare utilization in this high-risk population. Walking and strengthening exercises can help to improve muscle strength and quantity as well as physical activity and capacity, but exercise interventions in left ventricular assist device recipients are not well established. A large proportion of left ventricular assist device recipients do not participate in center-based, supervised cardiac rehabilitation (cardiac rehabilitation), and patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation initiate therapy a mean of 3 months after hospital discharge. A home-based exercise program using mobile technology may allow patients to begin exercise rehabilitation at an earlier time after left ventricular assist device implantation. We are conducting a randomized, controlled pilot study of a home-based exercise program including walking and strengthening exercises with a standardized protocol to guide exercise prescription and exercise progression based on data obtained from an activity tracking watch and smartphone app. Our pilot data suggest that our innovative home-based exercise program is feasible, safe, and may be associated with a greater increase in daily physical activity in patients newly implanted with a HM3 left ventricular assist device. The effects of a home-based exercise program using mobile technology on daily physical activity and capacity, frailty and sarcopenia, and quality of life in left ventricular assist device recipients have not been previously studied in a multicenter study. We propose a randomized study of 80 newly implanted HM3 left ventricular assist device patients at 4 left ventricular assist device centers. Following index hospital discharge after left ventricular assist device implantation, patients will be enrolled and randomized to a 6month novel exercise program using mobile technology or usual care (usual care). We will evaluate the following specific aims: Specific Aim #1 is to compare the effects of the exercise intervention vs. usual care on physical activity and capacity measured by a) daily steps (captured by the activity monitor) and b) 6MWT distance. Specific Aim #2 is to compare the effects of the exercise intervention vs. usual care on frailty and sarcopenia, by evaluating a) frailty status and b) muscle quantity. Specific Aim #3 is to compare the effects of the exercise intervention vs. usual care on quality of life (measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-12). Specific Aim #4 is to evaluate the cost-benefit of the exercise intervention vs. usual care.

Plasma membrane NHE isoforms have been thoroughly characterized and pharmaceutically targeted. In contrast, intracellular NHE remain poorly studied due to limitations and challenges in sensing organelle-specific lumenal ions. Furthermore, overlapping distributions of endosomal isoforms NHE6 and NHE9 isoforms and contradictory reports on the direction of sodium and proton transport within organelles has hindered a mechanistic understanding of transporter function and physiology. Case reports linking disease to endosomal isoforms NHE6 and NHE9 genetic variants are sporadic and genotype-phenotype correlations are incomplete. This proposal brings together three research groups with unique and complementary expertise, together with powerful tools and resources to tackle these problems. To overcome the technical challenges in measuring the activity of these transporters, we have developed a multi-functional fluorescent reporter for both Na+ and H+ to precisely assay intracellular Na+/H+ exchange. This reporter can be targeted to specific organelles to simultaneously read out Na+ and H+ levels therein using an imaging method called two-ion measurement. In Aim 1, we will deploy this reporter to specific compartments along the endo-lysosomal pathway to quantify [Na+] and [H+] in both healthy and disease states. We will determine the functional contribution and mode of transport of individual endosomal isoforms NHE6 and NHE9 isoforms in key organelles. This aim will lay the groundwork for functional analysis of clinically impactful gene variants in endosomal isoforms NHE6 and NHE9. To capture the disease landscape for endosomal isoforms NHE6 and NHE9, in Aim 2 we will evaluate the clinical significance of rare and common gene variants in SLC9A6 and SLC9A9. For these analyses, we will leverage large-scale exome sequencing of a clinical cohort, paired with their de-identified electronic health records. Combining genetic associations, gene expression and functional analysis will provide mechanistic insight on the biological basis of disease associated with endosomal isoforms NHE6 and NHE9. In summary, our comprehensive biochemical mapping of the endo-lysosomal pathway and disease-agnostic approach to link gene variants and expression to phenotypes will capture a broad range of cellular and clinical correlates that will pave the way to successful therapeutic targeting of these transporters in disease.",5,5R01GM147197-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,8,7,0,0

Most studies that have explored the relationship between stress and adverse pregnancy outcomes have focused solely on prenatal exposure to stressors, but Black women are generally exposed to more stressors over the life course than White women. Moreover, Black women may have more limited resources to cope with social stressors, as well as be more likely to experience enduring stressors like racial and/or gender discrimination, which may lead to dysregulated physiological and psychological responses to everyday stressors (i.e., stress reactivity). Several studies have shown dysregulated cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, and affective reactivity to stressors is associated with increased CVD risk and other adverse health outcomes in non-pregnant populations, but the impact of dysregulated stress reactivity on pregnancy outcomes remains poorly understood. Thus, the overall goal of this study is to examine the impact of physiological and psychological stress reactivity on adverse placental and pregnancy outcomes. We will use ecological momentary assessments and intensive measurements of heart rate variability, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and positive and negative affect to generate personalized measures of how pregnant women respond to stressful experiences in their daily lives. We will then examine associations of these measures with adverse placental lesions and pregnancy outcomes.

Despite this, the specific mechanism through which oxytocin exerts this modulatory effect on cocainerelated behaviors remains unclear. The present research project proposes that oxytocin attenuates cocaineassociated preference via a two-fold mechanism on dopamine (dopamine) neurons within the ventral tegmental area (ventral tegmental area). Recent evidence suggests that oxytocin receptors (oxytocinRs) on ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons both increase tonic firing of the dopamine neuron and decreases excitatory inputs, likely affecting phasic activation of the dopamine neuron. This decrease in excitatory inputs has been shown to be mediated by an oxytocin interaction with presynaptic CB1 receptors (CB1 receptors) on glutamatergic terminals. This project investigates the functional relevance of this effect using a novel combination of transgenic rat and virally-delivered shRNA to silence ventral tegmental area dopamine oxytocinRs or presynaptic glutamatergic CB1 receptors. First, oxytocinRs on dopamine ventral tegmental area neurons will be silenced in male and female rats using a transgenic Cre rat and Cre-dependent knockdown of oxytocinRs to determine the effect of oxytocin-mediated dopamine firing rate. Behaviorally, oxytocin attenuates cocaine preference behaviors, and it is expected that silencing of oxytocinRs on ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons will diminish this effect. Second, to further elucidate the specific mechanism through which oxytocin attenuates cocaine preference via ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons, CB1 receptors on ventral tegmental area glutamatergic inputs will be silenced using a combination of transgenic Cre rat and shRNA silencing of CB1R in the absence of Cre expression. oxytocin is known to reduce neuronal excitation through production of endocannabinioids (endocannabinioids) that retrogradely reduce presynaptic input via CB1 receptors. Through this, the effect of glutamatergic CB1R silencing will be assessed on oxytocin-mediated ventral tegmental area dopamine phasic neuronal firing. Behaviorally, this demonstrates that oxytocin-mediated reduction of ventral tegmental area dopamine phasic firing underlies oxytocin-mediated attenuation of cocaine-associated preference. Overall, this project will utilize a novel combination of tools to investigate the specific neural mechanism through which oxytocin attenuates cocaine reward and offer insight into the use of oxytocin as a therapeutic target for cocaine-related disorders in males and females.",5,5R21DA058205-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,0,1,8,1

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) pay Medicare Advantage plans a monthly capitated rate to cover nearly all health care expenses for plan enrollees. Medicare Advantage plans keep as profits the portion of payments that are not used to cover enrollee expenses. In addition, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services grants Medicare Advantage plans greater freedom to manage enrollees' health care use, for example, through tools such as narrow provider networks and broader coverage of delivery innovations such as telemedicine. Proponents argue that these financial incentives and effective tools for Medicare Advantage plans might enable them to provide care more efficiently than TM. On the other hand, these effects could be offset by financial incentives under capitation to limit service provision beyond what is necessary to improve short term health, resulting in adverse impacts on longer-term outcomes. Prior work has primarily estimated cross-sectional comparisons of TM and Medicare Advantage enrollees, which could lead to biased estimates if Medicare Advantage enrollees differ from TM enrollees in other ways that are related to health care use and health outcomes. Our proposed project will study changes in Medicare Advantage enrollment coming from seven states that recently changed public retiree health benefits from supplemental TM coverage to mandatory Medicare Advantage plans (or in one state, from a mandatory Medicare Advantage plan to supplemental TM coverage). We will use these natural experiments, along with comprehensive Medicare data for TM and Medicare Advantage enrollees, to estimate the causal impact of Medicare Advantage enrollment on health care use, quality, and patient outcomes. These results will provide important evidence to policymakers weighing broader expansions of Medicare Advantage.",5,5R01AG071731-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,1,3,3,2

Consequently, approaches to induce tolerance in the brain against ischemia have gained new momentum in clinical and experimental studies. However, mechanisms of ischemic preconditioning (ischemic preconditioning) have been primarily studied in gray matter (WM (gray matter (WM), despite white matter (WM (white matter (WM) injury and axon dysfunction being critical components of clinical deficits observed in stroke patients. Moreover, most in vivo models of ischemic preconditioning performed in rodents consist of short episodes of hypoxia/ischemia and are not applicable to translate into clinical settings as therapeutics. Therefore, there is an unmet need to establish clinically applicable pharmacological approaches to preconditioning the brain against ischemia. Our preliminary results show that CX-4945 (Silmitasertib), an FDAapproved Casein Kinase 2 (Casein Kinase 2) inhibitor, preconditions white matter (WM, promotes axon function recovery and improves behavioral outcomes after an in vitro or in vivo ischemic injury. Although aging reduces neuronal ischemic preconditioning, CX-4945 comparably preconditions young and aging white matter (WM by preserving mitochondrial motility. Because the threshold to precondition is reported to be higher in females, the main goal of this current proposal is to understand the mechanisms of preconditioning conferred by Casein Kinase 2 inhibition in young and aging male and female white matter (WM. We have reported that Casein Kinase 2 signals via the CDK5 and AKT pathways to mediate ischemic white matter (WM injury. Thus, Casein Kinase 2 inhibition correlates with the preservation of oligodendrocytes, axon structure and function, and conservation of mitochondrial dynamics in young and aging white matter (WM. Our preliminary data show that a brief period of Casein Kinase 2 inhibition with CX-4945 effectively preconditions axon function by maintaining mitochondrial motility. Furthermore, preconditioning with CX-4945 considerably attenuates behavioral deficits observed after an in vivo focal subcortical white matter (WM injury. We identified miR-501 as an ischemia-upregulated miRNA that is suppressed by Casein Kinase 2 inhibition, and reciprocal interaction between levels of miR-501 and Miro-2 regulates axonal mitochondrial motility. A similar upregulation of miR-501 levels in stroke patient plasma samples compared to ageand sexmatched controls propose Casein Kinase 2 as a clinically relevant therapeutic target. Therefore, we propose to extend these studies by testing our novel hypothesis that Casein Kinase 2 inhibition preconditions white matter (WM by differentially regulating the CDK5 and AKT signaling pathways to maintain mitochondrial dynamics by reciprocally regulating miR-501 and Miro-2 levels. We will combine electrophysiology, advanced imaging, functional analysis of mitochondria, mouse miRNA expression and regulation studies, human miRNA expression in plasma and human brain studies, and validation of regulated signaling molecules to determine whether Casein Kinase 2 inhibition acts via CDK5 or AKT to regulate mitochondrial proteins through alteration of miRNA profiles to precondition white matter (WM against ischemia.",5,5R01NS132492-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,2,6,6,1

Mapping the function of every gene in human cells will enable us to begin to define how gene expression programs impart specialized and adaptive human cellular functions required for life. We are especially interested in how transcription factors and epigenetic regulators enact cell type specific gene expression programs to dictate cell function during early development. Elucidating how individual genes function to regulate transcription and thus to program cell phenotypes will transform our understanding of human biology, development and disease. A mechanistic understanding of gene function requires scalable approaches for perturbing gene activity, single cell molecular phenotyping assays and robust models of human multicellular biology. We recently developed CRISPRoffa programmable epigenetic memory writer consisting of a single dead Cas9 fusion protein that durably and robustly silences gene expression. Unlike CRISPR mutagenesis approaches, CRISPRoff gene silencing effectively programs null alleles at the level of target gene mRNA and protein in polyclonal cell populations without induction of DNA damage or the unpredictability of DNA repair processes. We are proposing to optimize a generalizable multiomic CRISPRoff platform for molecularly phenotyping null alleles at single-cell resolution in multicellular models of human development. We will then use this CRISPRoff platform to create single-cell molecular multiomic maps of nuclear gene function across space and time. Lastly, we will evaluate genetic compensation and paralog functional redundancy in multicellular models. Our proposed research will serve to demonstrate the utility of this multiomics CRISPRoff platform for characterizing null alleles and motivate extending this approach to functionally map null allele phenotypes for all genes encoded by the human genome.

We hypothesize that lifelong exposure to inhaled Fe via air pollution (air pollution) is a contributor to elevated brain Fe and Alzheimer's Disease risk. In support of this hypothesis, air pollution has been linked to increased risk for Alzheimer's Disease with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) associated with increased risk for dementia, reduced memory, processing speed and increased cognitive impairment, PM2.5 exposures include ultrafine particles and metal contaminants. Of the many redox active metals/trace element pollutants in air pollution, Fe is often found at the highest concentrations. Studies examining Fe in frontal cortex of Alzheimer's Disease brains reported an abundant presence of magnetite (Fe2+/Fe3+ iron oxide) nanoparticles, consistent with an exogenous exposure rather than endogenous Fe source. It is critical to note that metal contaminants in air pollution are not borne equally by everyone. Low socioeconomic status (socioeconomic status) communities show the highest air pollution and metal contamination levels (Fe - top percentiles ~0.135 μg/m3). In fact, neighborhood-level socioeconomic status measures associate with memory and dementia risk. Further support for differential risk and the need to investigate inhaled Fe toxicity comes from the subway systems where Fe levels range 1000 x higher, from 141±81 to 329±116 μg/m3. These ""ambient"" and ""subway"" level concentrations provide the rationale for our experiments evaluating the link between inhaled Fe and neurodegenerative risk. Our preliminary data in mice demonstrates that inhaled Fe at ""Subway"" concentrations (~135 μg/m3) increases brain corpora amylacea, elevates phosphorylated tau protein levels, and results in female-specific hippocampal reductions and memory deficits. (AIM 1). We will evaluate whether Alzheimer's Disease-associated phenotypes arise at lower, closer to ambient Fe level exposures (1.35 μg/m3) and evaluate a time course of prodromal progression seen in Alzheimer's Disease studies, while differentiating between exogenous inhaled Fe from endogenous Fe. (AIM 2) Further escalating risk in these communities, poverty-related stress is characterized by a largely uncontrollable set of conditions, comprising a major risk factor for cognitive decline. Higher perceived stress is associated with increased risk for mild cognitive impairment, and two or more stressful life events increases risk for all-cause dementia. We predict that ""ambient"" Fe and deprived environments with uncontrollable stress exposures will result in Alzheimer's Disease neuropathology and memory loss, similar to higher ""Subway"" exposures. (AIM 3) We additionally predict that, conversely, enrichment with controllable stress will improve memory and ameliorate deficits associated with ""Subway' level Fe inhalation. These outcomes will derive from shared biological effects on oxidative stress and ferroptosis, with consequently increased neuroinflammation, reactive astrogliosis with white matter damage and neuronal loss. This research will inform public health policy and prevention to improve quality of life by mitigating cognitive and memory loss.

However, recent work also implicates the phonological domain, as indicated by deficits in producing word and nonword forms. The hypothesis driving the current proposal is that morphological and phonological deficits are causally linked by a broader deficit in sequential pattern learning. The unique approach taken here combines what we already know about morpho-syntactic deficits in DLD with recent developments in the fields of linguistics and language acquisition. First, it is possible to divide phonological and morphological patterns into three pattern types (Single Feature, OR/Disjunction, Family Resemblance/Prototype), with these types having a long history of study in visual pattern learning. Importantly, children with DLD appear to have maximum difficulty with morphosyntactic patterns of the OR type (e.g., regular past tense). In contrast, studies using artificial grammars show that infants who are typically developing are highly adept at learning Single Feature and OR pattern types; Family Resemblance patterns may be weaker. Typical adults are adept at Single Feature and Family Resemblance patterns, but appear to be, at least superficially, more like children with DLD in their performance on the OR pattern. With these intriguing findings as a starting point, the proposed research links phonological and morphological sequence learning in children with DLD. In Aim 1, we ask if 4to 6-year-olds (typically developing (typically developing), DLD alone, DLD + speech sound disorder (sound disorder), and sound disorder with no morpho-syntactic deficit) and adults are sensitive to input examples that fit one of these three patterns. We predict that, consistent with their long-documented morpho-syntactic deficit, children with DLD will have particular difficulty with the phonological OR pattern. Consistent with their intact morpho-syntactic skills, children with sound disorder should show no deficits in the OR pattern, revealing a link between OR pattern learning, phonology, and morpho-syntax. Aim 2 explores whether the inclusion of a semantic subcategory cue facilitates learning the OR pattern. Aim 3 asks if dependence on the associatively organized lexicon can account for the infant-to-adult developmental changes observed for the OR pattern (which is not associatively organized) and thereby explores the possibility that children with DLD rely on their lexicons to compensate for their sequential pattern learning deficit. The results of the proposed studies promise to help identify the underlying mechanism(s) of DLD and to suggest possible intervention strategies, such as employing semantic cues to the OR pattern and strengthening lexical organization.",5,5R01DC018410-06,PA-19-091,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,0,1,5,1

Allelic exclusion is achieved via mono-allelic initiation of RAG1/RAG21/RAG1/RAG22 (RAG1/RAG2) nuclease-mediated V gene segment recombination, followed by protein from a V(D)J rearrangement signaling permanent feedback inhibition of V recombination on the other allele. A shortcoming of this control is that it needs time for completion of recombination, expression and signaling of protein, and changes on the second allele. The applicant demonstrated that RAG1/RAG2 DNA double strand breaks (double strand breaks) induced during Vk-to-Jk recombination in pre-B cells signal via the ATM kinase to inhibit Rag1/Rag2 expression, Jk accessibility, and RAG1/RAG2 cleavage of the other allele until after the first allele is repaired. He showed that ATM deficiency in mice increases bi-allelic Igk IgH, or TCRb expression. While these data imply that ATM enforces allelic exclusion by signaling DSB feedback inhibition of V recombination, they neither prove this model nor rule out a role for ATM-stimulated DSB repair. The applicant shows new data that ATM enforces Igk allelic exclusion by signaling via the NFkB essential modulator (NFkB essential modulator) protein, with inhibition of Rag1/Rag2 transcription likely key for inter-allelic control of Vk recombination. The applicant shows that RAG1/RAG2 double strand breaks during IgH D-to-J recombination in pro-B cells or TCRb D-to-J, TCRg, and/or TCRd recombination in DN thymocytes do not require ATM to repress Rag1/Rag2 expression. However, these RAG1/RAG2 TCR double strand breaks signal via ATM to repress expression of a Vb region anti-sense long non-coding RNA, which the applicant shows is expressed only in DN cells where Vb and Db-Jb segments interact and rearrange over vast genomic distances. Based on these data, the applicant hypothesizes that RAG1/RAG2 double strand breaks feedback inhibit V(D)J recombination through complementary mechanisms, including cell type-specific signaling pathways that repress Rag1/Rag2 transcription and antigen receptor locus-specific alterations that suppress V rearrangements. He proposes two independent aims to test fundamental aspects of his model. Aim 1 proposes to elucidate how RAG1/RAG2 double strand breaks induced during different types of rearrangements in different cell types signal repression of Rag1/Rag2 transcription to coordinate initiation of V-to-(D)J recombination between alleles and thereby enforce allelic exclusion. Aim 2 proposes to determine the role of V region anti-sense long non-coding RNAs in promoting long-range V-to-(D)J rearrangements and serving as a DSB-responsive switch to transiently inhibit these rearrangements and thereby orchestrate allelic exclusion. The proposed work will employ powerful mouse models to rigorously elucidate mechanisms by which RAG1/RAG2 double strand breaks trigger transient feedback inhibition of V recombination to help enforce allelic exclusion. The project will provide novel mechanistic insights into one understudied and one completely novel line of research in the field, the latter relevant to the biology all cells.

Mechanistic-based therapeutic strategies to enhance muscle recovery in older adults do not exist. Synchronized muscle interstitial cellular events involving immune cells (e.g., macrophages), fibro-adipogenic progenitor (fibro-adipogenic progenitor) cells and satellite cells are critical to promote myogenesis, extracellular matrix (extracellular matrix) remodeling, and ultimately, restore muscle size and function. However, in aging, senescence cells exceed the rate of removal during recovery from injury resulting in excessive senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP; secretion of factors such as pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators) thereby amplifying dysfunction in macrophages, fibro-adipogenic progenitors and satellite cells and resulting in poor extracellular matrix remodeling. Metformin has been implicated to have positive effects on muscle size and function through non-glycemic mechanisms. Of interest to the current proposal, metformin has been shown to enhance macrophage function and lessen cellular senescence burden by targeting SASP in a variety of muscle interstitial cell. However, the role of metformin to improve extracellular matrix remodeling and muscle recovery in older adults following disuse atrophy through immunomodulating and senomorphic mechanisms have not been examined. We provide compelling data in older adult skeletal muscle that a clinical dose of metformin can potentially improve muscle macrophage, fibro-adipogenic progenitor and satellite cell function while also decrease muscle fibrosis and cellular senescence and SASP. Therefore, the purpose of this application is to conduct a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in older adults to determine if short-term metformin delivery (vs placebo) during the recovery phase following disuse atrophy can improve macrophage function, reduce cellular senescence and SASP, and enhance extracellular matrix remodeling thereby facilitating muscle regrowth. We will use state-of-the-art methodologies and elegant in vivo and vitro approaches to identify the impact metformin treatment on macrophage, fibro-adipogenic progenitor and satellite cell senescence and SASP, collagen organization, and muscle regrowth in aging. We anticipate that the findings will aid in the repurposing of metformin to be timely delivered to accelerate the recovery of aged muscle following disuse related events (e.g., surgery, illness).",1,1R01AG086328-01,PA-20-183,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,8,7,0,0

Neuroadaptations in corticostriatal projections to nucleus accumbens are critical for the development of compulsive-like alcohol use behaviors, including in an aversion-resistant drinking model. Yet it remains unclear how potentiated activity in nucleus accumbens neurons alters sensitivity to aversive outcomes during consumption and seeking of alcohol. Pre-existing individual differences in aversion-related circuits have been shown to predict future compulsive-like alcohol consumption. Yet, we are not aware of any demonstrations of alcohol-induced neuroadaptations in aversion-related circuits that track the development of aversion-resistant drinking, and that account for the emergence of this compulsive phenotype after alcohol exposure. Our long-term goal is to identify dynamics changes in the activity of aversion-related neural circuits that drive the emergence of compulsive alcohol use. Here, we will examine glutamatergic basal forebrain neurons that project to the lateral habenula. These neurons are found in an anterior-posterior continuum from the ventral pallidum to the lateral hypothalamus and are targeted by nucleus accumbens inhibitory projection neurons. We hypothesize that the emergence of aversion-resistant drinking requires selective inhibition of these neurons during alcohol consumption. A crucial first step in our investigation of this circuit is to determine whether the emergence of aversionresistant drinking is correlated with cell-type specific alterations in drinking-related neural activity in the glutamatergic basal forebrain. We will assess this question, and whether these neural correlates are downstream of nucleus accumbens mechanisms in Aim 1. Our second goal is to examine lateral habenula glutamate activity dynamics during aversion-resistant drinking. Therefore, our Aim 2 experiments will utilize a fluorescent glutamate sensor combined with fiber photometry to identify temporally-specific neural correlates of aversion-resistant drinking. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use chemogenetic approaches to assess the functional contributions of basal forebrain projections to lateral habenula in aversion-resistant drinking and determine which inputs to lateral habenula from regions of the glutamatergic basal forebrain most effectively modulate compulsive alcohol consumption.

This ability arises from inductive bias, referring to the assumptions used in generalizing prior observations to novel data.

In neuroscience, inductive bias has been mostly considered as shaped by evolution to produce an innate inductive bias. Although an agent's inductive bias should be adaptive to changing task demands, how brains develop inductive bias, use it to guide learning, and adapt it to task statistics, remain poorly understood. The overall goal of this project is to study the neural and computational bases of inductive bias adaptation by training non-human primates on a novel learning task, characterizing choice behavior and neuronal activity, and developing computational models of learning in neural networks. Our theoretical framework of neural kernel learning makes precise predictions for behavior and neural activity that will be experimentally tested in the proposed studies.

As initiation is the rate-limiting step of translation, currently, it is widely accepted that the accumulation of tRNA fragments (tRNA fragments) negatively regulates translation initiation leading to global translation attenuation. Notably, NSUN2, an RNA methyl-transferase that converts cytosine to 5-methylcytosine (methyl-transferase that converts cytosine to 5-methylcytosine), is required for decoding activity and stability of tRNAs and coding/noncoding mRNAs. NSUN2 mutations have been broadly involved in developmental defects, including male infertility, Dubowitz-like syndrome, and intellectual disability, as well as in cancer. Hypo-methyl-transferase that converts cytosine to 5-methylcytosine-methylated tRNAs accumulated in NSUN2 knockout (knockout) or mutant somatic cells are cleaved by endonuclease angiogenin, and the resulting tRNA fragments inhibit translation initiation globally. Lower protein synthesis correlates well with lower NSUN2 expression in somatic/cancer stem cells than committed or differentiated cells under homeostasis and tumorigenesis. However, this cannot explain the translation attenuation in pluripotent stem cells, the versatile cellular system for modeling diseases and early development, because NSUN2 is highly enriched under the selfrenewal and undifferentiated state of these cells. Moreover, our preliminary data show that NSUN2 knockout ESCs are well maintained without global translation reduction but with a hyper-pluripotent state concomitant with the upregulation of the naïve marker NANOG protein expression. This proposal aims to study methyl-transferase that converts cytosine to 5-methylcytosine RNA targets of NSUN2 and understand how they are regulated at the translation level to dissect unique functions of NSUN2regulated epitranscriptome in the translation control of stem cell pluripotency, which is fundamental to developmental biology and disease modeling. This proposal will explore the liquid-liquid phase separation (liquid-liquid phase separation) potential of methyl-transferase that converts cytosine to 5-methylcytosine mRNAs and their readers for translation control. We will test the hypothesis that NSUN2modified methyl-transferase that converts cytosine to 5-methylcytosine mRNAs are sequestered into P-bodies (P-bodies) through the RNA-binding protein YBX1-mediated liquid-liquid phase separation process, leading to translation attenuation of NSUN2 targets in pluripotent stem cells. Two aims are proposed to test the hypothesis. 1) Identify methyl-transferase that converts cytosine to 5-methylcytosine RNA targets of NSUN2 and YBX1 for translational control of stem cell pluripotency. 2) Establish liquid-liquid phase separation-mediated translation repression of methyl-transferase that converts cytosine to 5-methylcytosine RNAs in pluripotent stem cells. The proposed work will fill a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of NSUN2-mediated RNA methylation for specialized translation control in pluripotent stem cells.

In addition, inflammation, a major risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer, can upregulate cytokines that can drive the formation of tumor-initiating cells. Thus, strategies that target both inflammation and cancer stem cells may be effective in decreasing the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Sulforaphane, a naturally-occurring isothiocyanate derived from cruciferous vegetables and particularly abundant in broccoli, has well-established anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities. However, the precise mechanism by which it inhibits tumorigenesis and whether it is capable of reducing colorectal cancer risk remain to be determined. We have previously demonstrated that sulforaphane inhibits NFκB-mediated inflammatory responses in breast cancer cells as well as the proliferation and self-renewal capacity of breast cancer stem cells. We now have preliminary data strongly suggesting that sulforaphane has similar effects in colon cancer cells and more importantly, can inhibit the growth of human organoids driven by an adenomatous polyposis coli mutation. Furthermore, mice fed a preparation of broccoli that is enriched in sulforaphane are more resistant to the development of colonic inflammation and adenoma formation.

We and others have established formation of the calyx of Held (calyx of Held) and its innervation of principal neurons (principal neurons) in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body as a model system to study neural circuit development. We showed that that the calyx of Held:principal neurons system, relative to other model systems, has precise onset and short duration of strengthening and pruning to a topographically mature circuit by postnatal day 9, prior to ear canal opening. Preliminary data demonstrates that suppression of spontaneous activity (spontaneous activity) targeted to the calyx of Held:principal neurons synapse prevents key aspects of principal neurons functional maturation. In this proposal we capitalize on this observation to define the functional and structural elements of circuit construction so that we can identify those maturational events that depend on spontaneous activity. Our research team brings extensive experience with biophysical and physiological properties of this system, which we examine at high (daily) temporal resolution. We leverage our experience with imaging and reconstruction of large electron microscopy volumes to specify global aspects of initial circuit topography along with subcellular detail as a precise structural framework to anchor our observations. We next explore cellular and molecular mechanisms that transmit information about neural activity to maturational programs at high temporal resolution, focused upon activity-dependent Ca2+ entry and phosphorylation of the constitutive transcription factor CREB.

Our proposal will focus on how to enhance the survival and repair of lung microvascular endothelial cells, which are essential for the maintenance of the alveolo-capillary membrane. To survive stress, injured cells engage a repair process, autophagy, characterized by a sequence of steps (flux) devoted to the lysosomal degradation of damaged proteins and organelles. Despite progress made in linking autophagy with COPD, little is known as to how cigarette smoking disrupts autophagic flux and approaches to restore its proper function are lacking. We propose to fill this knowledge gap, by elucidating the regulation of lysosomal fitness and autophagic flux by sphingolipid metabolites during homeostasis and cigarette smoking exposure. We uncovered two sphingolipid rheostats (sphingosine/S1P and ceramide/glucosylceramide) that control the autophagy flux, but are disturbed by cigarette smoking. We hypothesize that restoration of the sphingolipid rheostat is required to complete lysosomal autophagy and repair cigarette smoke-induced lung microvascular endothelial cell injury and will alleviate emphysema. We will use complementary approaches of human lung primary endothelial cells in 2D and 3D models of repair, including co-cultured with alveolar type II epithelial cells, human precision cut lung slices, and mouse models of cigarette smoking exposure, to pursue three specific aims. Completion of these aims will fill important knowledge gaps in emphysema pathogenesis, will mechanistically link targeted metabolomics with functional outcomes, and provide potential new targets for treatment of emphysema.",5,5R01HL077328-19,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",3,4,0,3

Membrane-bound organelles form collaborative networks through transport vesicles and inter-organellar interaction domains to traffic cargo and distribute lipids throughout the cell. Conversely, membrane-less organelles mobilize the aqueous portion of cells into condensed structures called condensates. The majority of membrane-less condensates enrich for RNAs and various proteins, which control RNA processing and function at nearly every step of the mRNA life cycle. We and others have recently identified a new class of inter-organelle interactions between membrane-bound organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane-less RNA-sequestering condensates, such as stress granules. Thus, the long-term goal of my research program is to define how and why these two types of organelles interact to gain a more seamless understanding of how the cytoplasm is organized in health and disease. The objective of this proposal is to identify the factors and utilities of interaction domains between the endoplasmic reticulum and two wellstudied RNA-sequestering condensates. Our central hypothesis is that the endoplasmic reticulum plays crucial roles in RNA condensate formation, maintenance, and disassembly through the formation of membrane-tocondensate interactions. Although in vitro and in vivo studies on RNA and protein condensation have revealed the some molecular and biophysical principles of condensates, the contribution of membranes to condensate mechanisms are poorly understood. In the first Project, my lab will elucidate how condensate components are recruited to the endoplasmic reticulum to stimulate RNA condensate formation and inhibition of mRNA translation. We will use biochemical and live-cell imaging approaches to identify the key membrane factors that control this new class of interaction domains. These studies will allow us to identify the molecular mechanisms behind our previous discovery of a surprising dependence of membrane-less condensate abundance on endoplasmic reticulum morphology. In the second Project, we will dissect endoplasmic reticulum-dependent mechanisms of stress granule disassembly. Specifically, we will identify new disassembly factors by taking advantage of our newly developed ability to uncouple stress granule fission from dissolution. Additionally, we will test whether increasing the rate of endoplasmic reticulum-mediated stress granule fission can drive the disassembly of disease-associated aggregates. Collectively, this work will reveal how a new cellular niche between membrane-bound and membrane-less organelles drives the dynamic compartmentalization and quality control of RNA processes. Therefore, we anticipate that the proposed work will have important implications for both basic science and translational medicine targeting neurodegeneration, cancer, and RNA viral infection.",5,5R35GM151054-02,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,7,2,0

Nonmuscle myosin-2 (Nonmuscle myosin-2) motors play an essential role in many aspects of these fundamental cellular processes by forming short bipolar filaments that interact with actin filaments. Nonmuscle myosin-2 motors are binary switches that alter between inactive and active states depending on the cellular context. The precise control of Nonmuscle myosin-2 motor activity is critical for its cellular function as master regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. Aberrant regulation due to mutations in Nonmuscle myosin-2 paralogs contribute to a whole host of diseases including blood and neurological disorders, heart diseases, deafness, nephritis, and cancers. Nonmuscle myosin-2-specific therapies are thus needed, yet the lack of basic knowledge about the structure and regulation of Nonmuscle myosin-2 paralogs is a bottleneck to their development. We aim to develop a detailed structural and mechanistic understanding of how force generation by Nonmuscle myosin-2 motors drive various cellular functions. Using innovative and interdisciplinary techniques including the state-of-the-art cryoelectron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, steady-state kinetics, in vitro motility assays and high-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we will systematically dissect the mechanisms of activation and regulation of Nonmuscle myosin-2. To achieve this, in Aim 1, we will determine the major structural states in the ATPase cycle of Nonmuscle myosin-2 motors to explain enzyme function. In Aim 2, we will determine a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the inactive state of fulllength Nonmuscle myosin-2 to explain its molecular architecture. In Aim 3, we will study the consequences of abolishing the ability to form an inactive state on the dynamics of Nonmuscle myosin-2 filaments in cells. Collectively, our studies will provide a deeper understanding of the structure, function and regulation of Nonmuscle myosin-2. Importantly, this knowledge will advance our understanding of emergent Nonmuscle myosin-2 functions in cells and thus, lay the foundation for future development of Nonmuscle myosin-2-specific therapeutics.",5,5R01GM143539-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,8,7,0,0

These defects are thought to drive human immunodeficiency virus disease progression by allowing translocation of luminal microbial products into the circulation, which triggers chronic systemic immune activation and disease progression. Although antiretroviral therapy (antiretroviral therapy) effectively suppresses viral replication in the blood, it does not restore homeostasis in the intestine, even after years of treatment. This contributes to increased morbidity and mortality due to inflammatory non-communicable diseases (non-communicable diseases) such as heart disease and stroke in people with human immunodeficiency virus (people with HIV). Despite the central role of intestinal barrier function in human immunodeficiency virus disease pathogenesis, little is known about the specific mechanisms by which human immunodeficiency virus results in epithelial damage. Studies of intestinal epithelial cell (intestinal epithelial cell) dysfunction in human immunodeficiency virus have relied primarily on correlative observations based on histology or peripheral biomarkers. Our proposal addresses critical gaps in knowledge by utilizing intestinal tissue samples from well-characterize cohorts of people with HIV and human immunodeficiency virus-uninfected individuals, along with novel in vivo mouse and ex vivo human cell models and state-of-the-art technologies to explore specific mechanisms by which human immunodeficiency virus contributes to intestinal epithelial cell death in people with HIV. We hypothesize that human immunodeficiency virusassociated defects in CD8+ T cell fatty acid (fatty acid) metabolism cause them to scavenge lipids from nearby intestinal epithelial cell, which leads to intestinal epithelial cell death. This intestinal epithelial cell death then results in intestinal barrier disruption. To address these hypotheses, we are proposing two complementary aims. In Aim 1 we will characterize the in vivo and ex vivo impact of human immunodeficiency virus infection on intestinal epithelial cell death in people with HIV using colon tissue samples obtained by endoscopy to characterize intestinal epithelial cell death and CD8+ T cell phenotypes. We will also utilize novel mini-gut organoid models that incorporate autologous tissue resident immune cells and in-depth single cell sequencing analysis leveraging a platform optimized for small sample sizes developed by collaborators at MIT. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms by which human immunodeficiency virus-associated dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism in intestinal CD8+ T cells disrupts the colonic epithelial barrier. In this aim we will utilize ex vivo human organoid and in vivo murine models to test the mechanistic role of impaired fatty acid metabolism in CD8+ T cell mediated intestinal epithelial cell death and intestinal barrier dysfunction. This approach will identify specific cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of human immunodeficiency virus infection on intestinal barrier function and systemic immune activation. To carry out these Aims we have assembled a team with combined expertise in human immunodeficiency virus disease, mucosal immunology, and GI pathology, who are well positioned to uncover specific mechanisms that underlie intestinal epithelial dysfunction in human immunodeficiency virus infection. This proposal will address important unknown mechanisms of intestinal epithelial cell biology that may help in the development of new strategies to reverse gut barrier defects in human immunodeficiency virus infection.",5,5R01DK133919-03,RFA-DK-20-022,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,9,11,1,3

The core symptoms of Long COVID are remarkably like chronic fatigue syndrome (chronic fatigue syndrome) with multisystem complaints including debilitating fatigue, fluctuating heart rate and headache. In chronic fatigue syndrome, an infectious trigger has been suspected but not proven and onset often follows flu-like symptoms. As disease mechanisms are not understood, the treatment options are currently symptomatic. Between 0.2-0.4% of the population suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the biological mechanisms and risk factors for Long COVID and test the hypothesis that Long COVID is a subtype of chronic fatigue syndrome. To elucidate potential mechanisms, we will use data from three different biobanks, a Long COVID genetics working group we have built and through a chronic fatigue syndrome consortium. In Aim 1, we will examine genetic risk factors and comorbidities through the Long COVID working group comprising 46 cohorts and over 1.5 million individuals. In addition, we will do a meta-analysis of chronic fatigue syndrome across three Biobanks (N = 740,000). This analysis will elucidate the connection between chronic fatigue syndrome and Long COVID and identify risk variants for both diseases. In Aim 2, we will explore contribution from immune molecules that fine tune response to pathogens. The immune defense relies on specific cells to prevent infection or to destroy viral and bacterial agents and the body's own infected cells alike. This aim will examine if the genetic variants that protect from infections, COVID-19, or comorbidities, predispose to Long COVID. We will specifically focus on those regions that have large explanatory power such as the human leukocyte antigen (human leukocyte antigen) in addition to exploring associations genome-wide at established COVID-19 loci. This aim will reveal which immune traits increase risk or protect from Long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome, elucidating the type of immune responses responsible for disease development. In Aim 3, we will estimate heritability and shared genetic vs. environmental risk. We will estimate the proportion of environmental and genetic factors behind chronic fatigue syndrome and Long COVID through analysis of siblings, twins, and the general population in FinnGen and UK Biobank. This aim distinguishes the risk contribution from environmental risk and genetics in the context of a shared environment providing insight into the strength of shared environmental vs. genetic factors that are needed for disease development. The proposed work elucidates risk factors and comorbidities that contribute to chronic fatigue syndrome and Long COVID including the possibly shared disease etiology, symptomatology, and comorbidity.

Such adaptation takes place across many different scales in both space and time. On cellular time scales, molecules in individual cells enable them to regulate metabolic genes and thrive despite changing carbon sources. Over generations, cells evolve and adapt to stresses such as antibiotics. In the work proposed here, we will uncover principles of such adaptation over the functional hierarchy from molecules to cells to populations. To achieve this goal, our laboratory will use our tradition of integrating precise measurements with biophysical theory on specifically constructed biological systems. Our first research thrust is built on the recognition that despite the amazing successes of molecular biology and genome science over the last half century, we still know next to nothing about how genes are regulated for more than 65% of the genes in the commensal gut bacterium E. coli, which is arguably biology's best-understood organism. With this award we will create a first draft of the regulatory genome for the entire E. coli genome - including the binding energies and identities of every transcription factor and the genes or operons that they regulate. A second thrust focuses on a key way that living organisms respond to intracellular and environmental signals: through conformational changes in individual allosteric proteins and in assemblies of proteins, such as those found in the spindle responsible for chromosome segregation. Using a system we developed to finely control cytoskeleton-motor interactions using light, we seek to discover a predictive theoretical framework that guides and constrains how we view assembly and adaptation. The third thrust in our study of adaptation will build upon the previous two threads by providing a rigorous examination of how genomes and the proteins that interact with them evolve. The specific case studies will focus on the evolution of transcriptional regulation with special emphasis on the response of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotic drugs. The cell is the fundamental organizational unit of living organisms and the work proposed here will provide a far-reaching but detailed view of how cells adapt. The approach we adopt is ultimately biophysical; we insist that our analysis of the cell be at once quantitative and predictive, sharpening our questions and deepening our understanding in a way that can ultimately be parlayed into new strategies for improving human health.",5,5R35GM118043-09,PAR-19-367,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

This project uses an interdisciplinary experimental-computational approach to dissect the signal processing operations supporting the control of eye movements by vestibular and visual sensory inputs. Rigorous experimental protocols, computational models, and statistical fitting approaches will be developed to characterize the signal transformations occurring at multiple sites in the relevant neural circuitry, to disentangle the roles of feedforward and feedback signals in the control of eye movement behavior. These approaches will be used to analyze how specific changes in the way vestibular and visual signals are processed by the circuit support adaptive changes in the amplitude and timing of the eye movement responses to these sensory inputs.

Biofilm formation in the organism is attributed to attachment via surface proteins and exopolysaccharides (exopolysaccharides). The exopolysaccharides of A. actinomycetemcomitans (actinomycetemcomitans), also referred to as PNAG, is often overlooked as a virulence factor of bacterial pathogenesis and only considered for its role in biofilm formation. PNAG plays a critical role in the evasion from macrophages, oral colonization, and bone loss. However, very little information is available for the regulation of PNAG production in actinomycetemcomitans. In other PNAG-producing bacteria, such as E. coli, the synthesis of PNAG is regulated by the second messenger, cyclic-di-GMP or the posttranslational carbon storage regulator CsrA. actinomycetemcomitans does not produce cyclic-di-GMP due to the absence of the genes responsible for its synthesis in the actinomycetemcomitans genome and the role of CsrA is unknown in actinomycetemcomitans. In the absence of such regulation, in anaerobic environment, actinomycetemcomitans could produce excessive amount of PNAG which is a highly energy consuming process and can potentially reduce fitness. A quorum sensing two-component system, QseBC, functions as a global regulator of virulence in actinomycetemcomitans but does not regulate PNAG genes actinomycetemcomitanspgaABCD. Thus, there is a knowledge gap regarding regulation of PNAG in actinomycetemcomitans. In search of novel mechanisms of regulation, we have identified two proteins, actinomycetemcomitansFlp-1 (a unique actinomycetemcomitans pili protein) and actinomycetemcomitansDcuB (an ABC succinate transporter involved in fumarate respiration), both of which impacted PNAG production. Succinate in an anaerobic environment contributes to dysbiosis of the oral microbiota and chemotaxis. Further, exogenous addition of succinate has been shown to accelerate periodontal disease and actinomycetemcomitans's ability to expel succinate through fumarate respiration and actinomycetemcomitansDcuB might be critical in disease initiation. These two proteins, apparently unrelated, appear to control PNAG production either independently or in a coordinated manner. Our overarching hypothesis is that actinomycetemcomitansFlp-1 and actinomycetemcomitansDcuB proteins regulate the PNAG production in actinomycetemcomitans either directly or indirectly. Such impact by actinomycetemcomitansFlp-1 and actinomycetemcomitansDcuB has not been reported in other PNAG-producing bacteria such as E. coli or S. epidermidis and these two proteins offer a unique opportunity to study the novel regulatory mechanism(s) operational in actinomycetemcomitans. Our immediate goal is to test the overarching hypotheses that actinomycetemcomitansFlp-1 and actinomycetemcomitansDcuB proteins regulate the PNAG production in actinomycetemcomitans and that the production of PNAG is unique in actinomycetemcomitans. The following aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1. Decipher the unique crosstalk mechanism between actinomycetemcomitansFlp-1 and PNAG production in actinomycetemcomitans. Hypothesis: actinomycetemcomitansFlp-1 is a signal for the induction of PNAG production in actinomycetemcomitans.

Parents influence children's dietary intake through their use of food parenting practices. Research to date shows positive associations of structureand autonomy supportfood parenting practices with healthful dietary intake and eating behaviors in children, whereas coercive controlling and indulgent practices have been associated with unhealthful dietary intake and the development of maladaptive eating behaviors over time. While research has historically evaluated parents' ""usual"" approach to feeding children via questionnaires, recent evidence reveals important withinand between-day variation in use of food parenting practices across time and contexts. Parents have identified a range of momentary factors (e.g., activities, limited time, stress) in everyday family life that alter their usual approach. Parents described shifts from the use of structureand autonomy supportfeeding practices to more indulgent and controlling practices in the face of external challenges. We have recently obtained quantitative evidence of these withinand between-day shifts in food parenting practices through the use of Ecological Momentary Assessment (Ecological Momentary Assessment); Ecological Momentary Assessment uses short surveys delivered to hand-held devices in real time throughout the day to capture dynamic changes in behaviors across time and context. For instance, we have observed that parental stress early in the day is associated with greater use of controlling feeding practices later in the day. Our goal is to build on and extend the evidence-base of food parenting approaches for preventing poor dietary intake among children. We argue that parents' approach to feeding varies across time and context and that a deepened understanding of the variability in food parenting practices and associated outcomes is necessary to design interventions to help parents maintain consistent use of supportive practices despite challenging circumstances. We propose to comprehensively investigate the impact of withinand between-day fluctuations in food parenting practices on children's dietary intake overtime using a longitudinal study conducted with a sample (n=240) of racially/ ethnicallyand socioeconomicallydiverse parent-preschooler dyads.

Disorders involving tooth eruption are prevalent, as high as 2-4% in permanent molars alone. Multiple molars are involved in severe cases such as rare genetic conditions of primary failure of tooth eruption (primary failure of tooth eruption) or, more commonly, bisphosphonate-induced arrest of tooth eruption in pediatric patients, which significantly compromise the patients' ability to chew effectively. Because these molars do not response well to conventional orthodontic approaches, innovative adjuvant therapies are needed to restore tooth eruption of affected molars for better clinical outcomes. Tooth eruption is regulated by cells in the dental follicle (dental follicle) surrounding developing molars, which express parathyroid hormone-related protein (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and its cognate PTH/parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor (PTH1R). Disruption of autocrine parathyroid hormone-related protein-PTH1R signaling in parathyroid hormone-related protein+ dental follicle cells causes failure of tooth eruption in murine molars that closely recapitulates the human primary failure of tooth eruption condition. Salt inducible kinases (Salt inducible kinases) are an essential downstream effector of PTH1R-cAMP/PKA signaling in bone, in which cAMPregulated PKA-dependent SIK inhibition is a key component of the anabolic actions of PTH. Small molecules SIK inhibitors hold promise as a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance cAMP-induced signals in a receptorindependent manner. In this proposal, we hypothesize that activation of the PTH1R signaling pathway by direct SIK inhibition can restore defective tooth eruption of molars in mouse models of genetically and pharmacologically induced tooth eruption disorders. In Aim 1, we will identify the roles of Salt inducible kinases in parathyroid hormone-related protein+ dental follicle cells in tooth eruption. We hypothesize that Salt inducible kinases regulate osteoblast cell fates of parathyroid hormone-related protein+ dental follicle cells and tooth eruption. We will define the function of SIK2/SIK3 by conditionally deleting these genes in parathyroid hormone-related protein+ dental follicle cells at the onset of tooth eruption. We will define short-term and long-term alterations in tooth eruption and tooth root structures of mutant molars using histological and 3D microCT analyses. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of SIK inhibition in rescuing primary failure of tooth eruption in molars. We hypothesize that SIK inhibition rescues failure of tooth eruption in molars genetically caused by PTH1R deficiency. We will determine the effects of SIK inhibition in a mouse model of primary failure of tooth eruption, in which PTH1R is conditionally deleted in parathyroid hormone-related protein+ dental follicle cells at the onset of tooth eruption. We will investigate whether primary failure of tooth eruption phenotypes can be rescued genetically by a concomitant loss of SIK2/SIK3, and pharmacologically by SIK inhibitor YKL-05-099. In Aim 3, we will define parathyroid hormone-related protein as a bisphosphonate target and effects of SIK inhibitors in rescuing tooth eruption. We hypothesize that parathyroid hormone-related proteinPTH1R signaling is altered in parathyroid hormone-related protein+ dental follicle cells in response to zoledronic acid (zoledronic acid), and zoledronic acid-induced arrest of tooth eruption in molars can be rescued by SIK inhibitors. We will treat zoledronic acid-treated young mice with YKL-05099 to rescue tooth eruption. We will also define how zoledronic acid inhibits parathyroid hormone-related protein-PTH1R signaling activities, and whether SIK inhibitors reverse zoledronic acid-induced alternation of parathyroid hormone-related protein signaling and aberrant parathyroid hormone-related protein+ dental follicle cell fates.",5,5R01DE030416-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH,15,2,0,0

The composition and function of the human microbiota is significantly influenced by access to key metal micronutrients including iron, copper, zinc, and cobalt. Although mechanisms of competition for metals have been studied in metal-limited environmental systems, how the human microbiota acquires metals and responds to changes in host metal homeostasis remains under investigated, even as microorganisms must compete with one another for limited resources at metal-limited body sites. Production of metallophores, smallmolecule natural products that bind metals with high affinity and selectivity, can enable colonization of metallimited environments; for example, we recently showed that Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 persists in the zinclimited inflamed gut by producing zinc-binding yersiniabactin. Metallophore-production can also benefit other, non-producer organisms in microbial systems, as metallophores can be shared goods in complex microbial communities. Recent examples have revealed that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a human commensal bacterium, uses siderophores produced by other bacteria for iron acquisition during iron-limitation. However, despite significant numbers of metallophore biosynthetic gene clusters (biosynthetic gene clusters) present in metagenomics sequencing data from human-derived microbiota samples, elucidation of the chemical structures and properties of these microbial molecules remain limited by various analytical, chemical, and biological challenges. This lack of reliable methods precludes our understanding of functional roles of these molecules. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to elucidate the structure and functions of microbially-derived metallophores as modulating microbe-microbe and community interactions within human microbiomes. To accomplish this, our laboratory will investigate several critical questions, broadly these are: 1) what metallophores are produced by the human microbiota and how are they biosynthesized? 2) what are their metal preferences and specificities? 3) how do these molecules modulate microbial interactions? 4) what are the effects of altered microbial interactions? With these questions in mind, we develop discovery-based approaches to find uncharacterized microbial metallophores, pursue chemical structure elucidation and characterization of biosynthesis, and investigate growth and metal acquisition of wild-type and genetic deletion mutants (lacking metallophore-production ability) to understand functional roles of these molecules in monoculture, co-culture, and in complex microbial model systems. Elucidating the metal-uptake molecules and mechanisms used by the microbiota to withstand altered metal homeostasis may allow for the development of microbiome-based therapeutics, identification of microbiome-derived biomarkers, and an improved understanding of metal imbalances. This research will provide fundamental insight how members of the microbiota interact through metal competition, a key mechanism by which both opportunistic infections and probiotic organisms are established and persist within the microbiome.",1,1R35GM155026-01,PAR-23-145,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,7,14,1,0

Like many other obesity-associated variants, despite a strong association, a causal relationship has yet been established. Otp encodes a transcription factor that is highly conserved across multiple species. Importantly, mice and humans share the identical amino acid sequence of Otp. To study the functional impact of OtpQ153R/+, we have generated new knock-in mice that carry the same human mutation. Similar to the human subjects, we found that mice heterozygous for OtpQ153R (OtpQ153R/+) survive through adulthood but develop obesity and glucose intolerance. These findings, therefore, strongly support a causal role for OtpQ153R/+ in human obesity. We propose to investigate the mechanisms behind OtpQ153R-induced obesity and glucose deficits. Otp is broadly distributed in the central nervous system. To determine the brain site where Otp deficiency impairs energy and glucose balance, we generated and characterized a floxed Otp allele (Otpflox). Our new preliminary studies show that selective loss of Otp in forebrain Sim1-Cre-expressing neurons reproduces lethality seen in Otp null mice, whereas its haploinsufficiency in these neurons results in obesity. Furthermore, we find that Otp is transiently expressed in a subset of immature POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus) and is required for the POMC→NPY/AgRP fate switch during development. Selective deletion of Otp in these neurons leads to a significant loss of POMC-derived NPY/AgRP neuron identity. Collectively, our new findings suggest that Otp plays critical roles in two distinct populations of hypothalamic neurons to regulate energy and glucose metabolism. In summary, the overarching goals of these studies are to better understand OtpQ153R-induced pathophysiology and develop mechanism-based therapeutics to mitigate metabolic syndrome in human OtpQ153R/+ patients.",5,5R01DK130892-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,2,13,6,1

Preserving those abilities has become a major public health priority. Balance training can enhance functional abilities or attenuate functional decline; however, age-related motor deficits may impair practice-based motor learning and behavioral performance. Due to the crucial roles of the spinal cord in balance and walking performance, it is important to consider that age-related neural impairment of the spinal cord is a likely contributing factor. Specifically, the spinal cord in older adults has fewer neurons, is less excitable, and conducts signals more slowly. Despite ample evidence of impaired spinal cord neuronal structure and function with aging, the potential benefit of an intervention targeting spinal control of balance and walking control has been largely unexplored. This dearth of research may be due in part to the lack of a clinically feasible intervention. However, the recent emergence of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation) as a non-invasive intervention creates new opportunities for understanding spinal cord contributions to balance and walking performance. The proposed study will be among the first multi-session trial to investigate the effects of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation as an adjunct therapy to dynamic balance training in older adults. We propose to include 30 participants 65 years of age or older with balance/walking deficits, who will receive active or sham transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation while performing a dynamic balance training intervention. Balance and walking performance assessments will be conducted after each of the five intervention sessions to examine the intervention's effects over time. Spinal excitability will be assessed immediately before and after transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation at the first and last intervention sessions. Behavioral assessments will only be carried out at baseline and 1 day post-intervention to investigate the pre vs. post intervention effect, with a 10-day period considered for the retention effect. During behavioral assessments, prefrontal cortical activity will be measured to provide insights into the demand for increased executive control. The first aim of the study will be to acquire preliminary effect size and response variance data to assess whether active adjuvant transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation therapy combined with dynamic balance training enhances practice-related gains in balance and walking performance and retention over time. The second aim of the study will be to establish evidence of increased spinal excitability following transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation, positively correlating with gains in balance and walking functions. The overarching hypotheses of the proposed study are that the positive effects of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation on practice-related enhancements and retention in balance and walking function will be related to increased spinal excitability. The long term deliverable of this line of research will be a clinically feasible multi-modal intervention to assist in preserving motor function and independence in older adults. The knowledge and experience gained from this study will enable us to conduct larger studies to better understand the effects of aging on the spinal cord and to test rehabilitation interventions to promote healthy aging among older adults.",1,1R21AG084944-01A1,PA-20-194,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,0,1,5,1

The first step in this process is the ability of strains to attach and adhere, on both biotic and abiotic surfaces. This attachment also is the first step in the formation of biofilms, which are linked with both persistence and antifungal drug resistance. However, the cell biology and genetic circuitry underlying the ability of C. auris to colonize the skin are not known. Our long-term goal is to identify the genetic determinants and regulation of C. auris skin colonization and thus persistence and transmission between individuals. This application details experiments to address a fundamentally important gap in our knowledge of mechanisms by which C. auris is a successful human fungal pathogen. We propose three complementary genomics approaches to explore the biology of C. auris skin colonization. We recently developed genetic tools for interrogating this organism, giving us unprecedented power to analyze the genes required for C. auris colonization. In Aim 1, we will use a population genetics and genome-wide association approach to identify naturally-occurring variants that are associated with increased attachment. In Aim 2, we will use a forward genetics screening approach and an in vitro model to uncover new effectors and regulators of C. auris skin attachment. In Aim 3, we will use experimental evolution to identify variants of concern for skin colonization, and connect this with functional experiments to test the impact of these variants. Together, these studies will advance new concepts for how C. auris can regulate adherence, colonization, and outbreak potential.",1,1U19AI181767-01,RFA-AI-23-015,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

Transmission blocking vaccines (Transmission blocking vaccines) induce antibodies that block parasite reproduction and development in the mosquito midgut and are part of the World Health Organization Malaria Vaccine Technology roadmap. This R01 response to program announcement PA-19-077: Accelerating Malaria Vaccine Discovery, which specifically encourages studies that will lead to discovery of new vaccine candidates that interrupt malaria transmission. Pfs48/45 is a TBV candidate antigen, and is the target of one of the most potent transmission-blocking monoclonal antibodies (85RF45.1). Pfs48/45 has not yet been tested in humans, in part due to difficulties in producing the antigen. We will follow-up on our recent advances in producing first-in-class, well-defined, fusion-free Pfs48/45. Serendipitously, glycosylation at a non-essential epitope of the protein led to drastically enhanced protein yield, enabling us to solve its three-dimensional structure, also revealing the target epitope of 85RF45.1. This newfound structural information will be used to guide advanced antigen design, including stabilizing mutations and antigen design that is immunofocused to the potent neutralizing epitope. Rationally-optimized Pfs48/45 will be optimized in the context of a next-generation vaccine adjuvant. This adjuvant enables combining (via simple mixing) well-characterized antigens with a liposomal adjuvant to induce spontaneous nanoliposome-antigen particleization (spontaneous nanoliposome-antigen particleization). We discovered that liposomes that contain small amounts of cobalt porphyrinphospholipid (cobalt porphyrinphospholipid) bind to well-characterized his-tagged antigens with simple mixing via spontaneous insertion of the his-tag into the bilayer. Unlike other approaches, cobalt porphyrinphospholipid liposomes give rise to rapid antigen particleization that is stable in biological media. His-tagged Pfs48/45 is simply mixed with cobalt porphyrinphospholipid liposomes without further purification to convert the soluble antigen into a 100 nm particle with uniform, arrayed antigen display. In some immunization conditions, spontaneous nanoliposome-antigen particleization immunization induces orders of magnitude higher functional IgG responses with TBV antigens compared to other vaccine adjuvants. Antibody durability compares favorably to current toxin conjugation strategies which have progressed into clinical studies. Using immunofocused and stabilized Pfs48/45 constructs, particleization parameters will be assessed and iterative antigen improvement will be carried out. Another relevant attribute of the spontaneous nanoliposome-antigen particleization approach that will be investigated is seamless multiplexing by simple mixing of multiple antigens at the time of immunization (without further purification), resulting in a balanced and functional IgG response (i.e. to each included antigen). The impact of multiplexing other TBV antigens (Pfs25 or Pfs230) on the Pfs48/45 response will be assessed, as will whether additive or synergistic functional activity is induced. Finally, the safety of spontaneous nanoliposome-antigen particleization immunization with the optimized Pfs48/45 construct and formulation will be tested.",5,5R01AI148557-05,PA-19-077,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

The front runner is RTS,S/AS01, a recombinant protein comprising portions of Plasmodium falciparum (Plasmodium falciparum) circumsporozoite protein (circumsporozoite protein). However, the observed vaccine efficacy to clinical malaria in children living in malaria endemic settings is only 36%. In order to understand how to improve upon this vaccine, a comprehensive evaluation of baseline and cumulative factors that impede malaria vaccine performance, in direct contrast to factors associated with protection from malaria, is needed. We have recently defined stronger correlates of protection based on functional antibody activity using a systems serology approach. To date, these system serology studies have been conducted only for adults from non-endemic regions. Here, we aim to test the overall hypothesis that children living in malaria endemic areas who have less mature or aberrant immune cells are unable to develop the breadth of functional antibodies and T cells elicited by RTS,S in order to become protected against malaria. Drawing on the WHO Malaria Vaccine Implementation Program in a hightransmission region in Kenya, we will employ an intensive longitudinal cohort study design to follow children during their 4-dose RTS,S vaccination schedule, with active and passive follow-up for Plasmodium falciparum infections and episodes of clinical malaria until they reach 4 years of age. Our overall hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: SA1: To comprehensively characterize baseline and peri-vaccination factors that correlate with vaccine hyporesponsiveness. Using an integrated systems immunology and machine learning approach, we will determine the effects of ongoing exposures to malaria, systemic inflammation, preexisting anti-malarial immunity, and immaturity of cellular immune signatures on RTS,S vaccine hyporesponsiveness, defined as the inability to develop a core group of functional anti-circumsporozoite protein antibodies. SA2: To comprehensively characterize the post-vaccination immune signatures in children that correlate with protection from malaria. Using a systems immunology approach, we will determine the function of vaccineelicited anti-circumsporozoite protein antibodies and their correlation with age, cellular immune signatures, and protection from malaria. Functional in vitro studies will assess antibody opsonization of sporozoites and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity with and without innate immune cells; assess the phenotype and function of vaccineelicited circumsporozoite protein-specific T cells; and explore the potential for epigenetic modifications of monocytes (trained immunity) to influence vaccine performance. Using a computational modeling/machine learning approach, we will integrate deep immunoprofiling features to predict correlates with protection from malaria. Together, this study aims to inform the next generation of malaria vaccines and vaccination programs that could include immune-modulatory components or recommendations to combine antimalarial prophylaxis/treatment within the vaccine schedule.",5,5U01AI165524-03,RFA-AI-20-064,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

However, little published research has rigorously quantified the impacts of state preemption of local tobacco control, particularly: 1) across states and over time; 2) across a broad range of tobacco control efforts (e.g., restrictions on advertising, youth access); 3) across a range of key outcomes (e.g., youth and adult tobacco use, secondhand smoke exposure [SHSe], tobacco retailer density); and 4) with regard to potential disproportionate impacts among certain subgroups that face tobacco-related disparities (e.g., racial/ethnic minorities, lower socioeconomic status [SES], those in rural settings). As initial evidence providing a basis for this proposal, our RWJF-funded research concluded that state smoke-free air preemption was associated with an increase in adult smoking prevalence and affect counties differently. This proposal will build on this work and advance the literature by filling the aforementioned gaps in the existing research. The long-term goal of this research is to inform policies to reduce tobacco use and related health disparities, as well as to inform policy efforts more broadly, particularly as public health issues, like firearm safety, nutrition policies, and COVID-19 mitigation measures, are increasingly subject to state preemption. Our objective is to advance our understanding of whether-and to what extent-enactment or repeal of state preemption on local tobacco control is associated with disparities in tobacco use, SHSe, and retailer density (sales, retailer densityer density). Our central hypothesis is that state preemption results in disproportionately high tobacco use, SHSe, and retailer density in communities with greater racial/ethnic minorities, of lower SES, and/or in rural settings. Our rationale is that, by preempting local tobacco control, state governments deprive localities of a crucial tool for reducing the burden of tobacco in their communities, potentially widening disparities. We will analyze national data from 1999 to 2021 to examine the impacts of enactment or repeal of state preemption of 5 state tobacco preemption (i.e., smoke-free policy, advertising, licensure, youth access, and taxation). Our specific aims are to examine state preemption on tobacco control in relation to changes in: 1) individual-level tobacco use (including e-cigs) in adolescents and adults and nonsmokers' SHSe, and potential disproportionate impacts among certain subgroups of individuals; and 2) sales of tobacco products and tobacco retailer density density over time, and potential disproportionate impacts among communities representing those facing tobacco-related disparities. We will employ multilevel models and crosswalk/merge (state/local laws, outcomes, sociodemographics) data from various sources at different geographic levels. This study will have high impact, as it will: 1) add to the evidence base regarding state preemption impact on population outcomes and mechanisms of impact; 2) inform efforts to reduce tobacco use and related disparities; and 3) engage key tobacco control and policy experts in research dissemination.",5,5R01CA275066-02,PAR-20-302,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,6,5,8,2

The active coping response set allows for the maintenance of lower levels of glucocorticoid stress hormones and sympathetic activity, due in part to the actual or perceived agency over aversive stimuli, and when active responses are restricted, such as in the passive coping set, behavioral passivity increases and HPA and sympathetic responses are exaggerated. In this regard, elevations in HPA and autonomic systems resulting from over-biasing toward passive coping contribute to psychiatric and systemic disease pathogenesis. Our unpublished data using pathway-specific optogenetic circuit analyses have revealed that two parallel pathways from caudal and rostral prelimbic (circuit analyses have revealed that two parallel pathways from caudal and rostral prelimbic) cortex, innervating dorsolateral and ventrolateral subdivisions of periaqueductal gray (dlPAG and vlPAG), that promote active and prevent passive behaviors, respectively, in response to acute stressors. Based on these preliminary data, we will examine the hypotheses that one or both of these pathways are required to promote an active coping set, whereas their diminished influence under chronic stress conditions biases the animal toward a passive coping set. The first aim will determine how activity changes in PAG projector neurons in PL correlate with active and passive coping behavior following chronic stress compared to rats with no previous exposure. Aims 2 and 3 will utilize pathway specific optogenetic manipulations to evaluate whether inactivation of either cPL-dlPAG or rPL-vlPAG pathways under acute stress conditions increases passive behavior and exaggerated HPA and sympathetic activation. Conversely, we will evaluate whether increasing activity in either of these pathways in chronically stressed rats can rescue an active coping set involving increased active behavior, and attenuated HPA and sympathetic output. In the fourth aim, we will address the complementary relationship between each circuit's function (i.e., cPL-dlPAG pathway promotes an active coping set; rPL-vlPAG pathway prevents a passive coping set), since these data implicate the predominance of one circuit over the other. Here, we will utilize an anterograde transsynaptic viral strategy to optogenetically test whether the cPL-dlPAG pathway engages vlPAG as a downstream mediator for restraining passive behavior and preventing exaggerated HPA and sympathetic activation under CVS conditions. These studies will advance a new framework for understanding the neural regulation of stress coping for translation to stress-related psychiatric diseasesby elucidating a novel circuitry and activity patterns of responses under acute and chronic conditions, and the expansion of the concepts of susceptibility and resilience to encompass behavioral, endocrine and physiological features.",5,5R01MH132207-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,5,1

At the cellular level, a well-established view of how experience can stably change behavior is that new mRNA and protein synthesis occurs, and that this new state becomes stably encoded in the chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that determines transcriptional state. Sleep is an extremely conserved drive found across the animal kingdom that may facilitate these processes. We hypothesize that one of the evolutionary conserved functions of sleep is to influence gene expression and chromatin regulation. There are multiple lines of evidence that support the idea that sleep is important for transcriptional regulation and chromatin stability, but to date no one has directly compared transcriptional responses to sleep loss across vertebrate species or between brain and other tissues within the same species. This is important because to determine conserved mechanisms it is necessary to compare across evolutionary time. Another key limitation of all omics studies of sleep is the lack of resolution at the single-cell level. This is important because, as show in our preliminary studies, different cell types respond differently to sleep loss. In addition, the lack of resolution at the single cell-level can make mapping correspondence between changes in gene expression and changes in chromatin inaccurate. The application of single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis is a promising avenue to understand transcriptional regulation. However, single-cell approaches have not yet been applied to understand how sleep influences transcription and chromatin regulation. In this Maximizing Investigators Research Award (Maximizing Investigators Research Award) we will utilize state of the art single-cell genomic technology to define, for the first time, common sleep-dependent transcriptional and epigenetic programs across different cell-types between two distantly related vertebrate species: Mouse and Zebrafish. This proposal leverages expertise in comparative genomics and evolution, computational biology and the application of transcriptomic and epigenomic technology to study brain and behavior, training I have acquired throughout my PhD and post-doctoral fellowship. The goal is to establish a program of research focused on understanding how sleep across different species can alter transcription and chromatin accessibility in different cell-types. In the short-term this proposal will produce a comprehensive cell atlas of sleep-dependent regulation of gene expression and chromatin states, as well as publicly available software for single-cell data analysis. In the long-term these studies will serve as the basis for functional studies to define evolutionary conserved mechanisms by which sleep can modulate gene expression and chromatin architecture.",5,5R35GM147020-03,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,10,10,2,0

Despite the effectiveness of combination antiretroviral therapy (combination antiretroviral therapy), patients experience side effects that challenge future treatment strategies. Since most drugs' therapeutic and toxic effects are directly related to drug exposure, identifying predictors of exposure can help better predict variability in response to medication. For the proposed project, we are leveraging the unprecedented time-series plasma samples collected during ongoing (AI153007) intensive pharmacokinetic (intensive pharmacokinetic) studies of dolutegravir (dolutegravir) and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (tenofovir alafenamide fumarate), a prodrug of tenofovir (tenofovir), in representative and understudied HIV+ men and women in the multi-ethnic cohort MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study). Given the recent development in the field of pharmacometabolomic, where endogenous metabolite concentrations in plasma are shown to predict response to sertraline, escitalopram, and aspirin, we plan to determine the plasma metabolome profile of MWCSS participants treated with dolutegravir and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate. Our immediate objective is to identify, through correlations of plasma drug concentrations with endogenous metabolite plasma levels. These genes control metabolic pathways affecting dolutegravir, tenofovir plasma, and tenofovir-diphosphate (tenofovir-dp) intracellular concentrations and their associated metabolic adverse effects (i.e., weight gain and insulin resistance). To achieve our immediate objective, we have three specific aims. In aim 1, we plan to identify endogenous metabolites associated with concentrations of dolutegravir (n=60), tenofovir, and tenofovir-dp (n~42) at nine different time points in virally suppressed HIV+ men and women under actual use conditions. Using these correlated metabolites as biomarkers of medication concentration, in aim 2, we will identify, through genome-wide association analyses, novel genetic variants impacting metabolite concentrations in 16,322 individuals from two independent population-based cohorts from the United Kingdom (UK): The UK National Institute of Health Research and Twins UK. The extensive UK sample size provides ample power to identify gene-metabolite associations reliably, offering a higher-resolution picture of metabolism and elimination for dolutegravir and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate. In aim 3, the effect of identified novel genes on dolutegravir, tenofovir, and tenofovir-dp concentrations and their associated metabolic adverse effects (i.e., weight gain, insulin resistance) will be further validated in 1157 MWCSS women and men treated with these medications. This novel approach will help identify new genes impacting dolutegravir and tenofovir plasma exposure and clinically significant adverse effects. The deliverables from this study will positively impact future studies in the field of PGx of antiHIV medication and beyond in two ways: First, we will characterize for the first time and with much higher resolution the primary and secondary metabolic and elimination pathways relevant to dolutegravir and tenofovir and second, it will provide a novel multi-omic study design that can be implemented to discover genetic factors associated with drug effect.",1,1R21AI177219-01A1,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,14,8,7,2

This challenge is compounded by the fact that these variants contribute to complex traits and diseases by interacting with one another and with genetic variation in repetitive DNA elements. Assessing the phenotypic consequences of all genetic interactions amounts to an impossible numbers game. In order to prioritize certain variant combinations, I will use model organisms with powerful genetics, namely the yeast S. cerevisiae and the worm C. elegans, to identify and characterize genetic interactions with large impact on complex phenotypes. I propose three projects that capitalize on our previous studies. These projects are united by their focus on genetic interactions (i.e. epistasis), albeit they address different types of variant combinations and different mechanisms. The first project focuses on rDNA, a highly variable repetitive DNA element. Variation in rDNA copy number impacts gene expression, replication, genome stability, and mitochondrial abundance. Like other repetitive loci, rDNA is predisposed to interact epistatically with other variants because of its high mutation rate. Using newly developed C. elegans mapping populations and robotics-enabled phenotyping, our preliminary data show that rDNA copy number variation affects lifespan and fitness through epistasis. High-throughput analyses of healthspan traits such as stress resistance and fertility are ongoing. We will pursue fine-mapping of the most significant genomic loci implicated in epistasis with rDNA because their identity, possibly DNA replication or repair genes, may point to the molecular mechanism by which rDNA variation affects phenotype. In both yeast and worms, we will use the entire tool box of genetics and genomics to directly interrogate the pathways by which rDNA copy number variation affects replication, genome stability, and mitochondrial abundance. To enable accurate high-throughput measurements of rDNA copy number in model organisms and humans, we will optimize a promising FISH technology. The second project relies on the detailed genotype-phenotype maps we established for genes in the yeast mating pathway. Selecting single nucleotide variants of small and intermediate effects, we will combine variants in two genes and test the combinations for mating efficiency while also perturbing strong genetic modifiers and applying common stresses. To do so, we developed a sequencing strategy that allows us to simultaneously phenotype tens of thousands of single nucleotide variant combinations between pairs of genes. The third project will apply a technology of dominant negative polypeptides that we recently developed to identify at genome scale protein interaction surfaces and their dynamics. In yeast, we will explore to what extent genetic interactions reflect direct protein interactions.

People and animal models evaluate outcomes as gains or losses relative to an internal reference point, likely reflecting their experience-based expectations. For example, if someone is told they will receive a particular salary at a new job, but when they start, they find that the salary is substantially less, they will view that salary (which is a net increase in wealth) as a loss relative to their reference point. Reference dependence is a consequential, ubiquitous phenomenon, driving decisions about insurance, financial products, labor, and retirement savings. The proposed work seeks to uncover how large populations of neurons represent a cognitive variable -the reference pointduring value-based decision-making. This work involves complementary, synergistic interactions between experimentalists and theorists in the labs of Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Cristina Savin, respectively. This proposal will develop a novel behavioral paradigm for studying reference dependence in rats, enabling application of powerful tools to monitor large-scale neural dynamics. High-throughput behavioral training will generate dozens of trained subjects for experiments in parallel. We will also develop a behavioral model to quantify key aspects of rats' behavior, including individual differences in behavior across animals (Aim 1). We will use new silicon probes with high channel counts (""Neuropixels"" probes) to record from populations of neurons in dozens of rats during behavior. Recordings will be obtained from the orbitofrontal cortex (orbitofrontal cortex), a key brain structure implicated in value-based decision-making. We will develop novel latent dynamics models that will infer the reference point directly from populations of simultaneously recorded neurons in orbitofrontal cortex, without any knowledge of the task or rats' behavior. This model will also be able to identify aspects of neural dynamics that are common across dozens of rats, and aspects that are variable across animals, reflecting individual differences in behavior (Aim 2). Finally, we will use complementary, state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to train recurrent neural networks (recurrent neural networks) on our behavioral and neural data. This approach will generate concrete hypotheses about the neural circuit architectures performing reference-dependent subjective valuation in our task (Aim 3).",5,5R01MH125571-05,PAR-20-003,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,5,1

The mechanisms underlying the maintenance and function of this intestinal barrier are not completely understood. Using a mouse forward genetic screen for defects of intestinal homeostasis, we have found a mutation in Tvp23b, which conferred susceptibility to both chemically induced and infectious colitis. Golgi apparatus membrane protein TVP23 homolog B (TVP23 homolog B) is a transmembrane protein conserved from yeast to humans. In the intestine, the protein is localized to the epithelium and its deficiency in the hematopoietic extrinsic compartment was essential to the colitis phenotype. We found that TVP23 homolog B controls the homeostasis of Paneth cells and function of goblet cells in vivo, leading to a decrease in antimicrobial peptides as well as a more penetrable mucus layer. As a result, Tvp23b-/- mice displayed decreased barrier function and a loss of host-microbe separation. TVP23 homolog Bdeficient colonocytes have a loss of core-3 O-glycosylation of colonic proteins, which is the major O-glycosylation present on gel forming mucins. TVP23 homolog B binds with another Golgi protein, YIPF6, which is similarly critical for intestinal homeostasis. The Golgi proteomes of YIPF6 and TVP23 homolog B-deficient colonocytes have a common deficiency of several critical glycosylation enzymes, including those necessary for core-3 glycosylation of mucins. TVP23 homolog B is necessary for the formation of the sterile mucin layer of the intestine and its absence disturbs the balance of host and microbe in vivo. In this proposal, we will examine the components that mediate the cellular and molecular dysfunction in TVP23 homolog B deficiency and the resulting pathology in three Specific Aims:  Determine the role of TVP23 homolog B in maintaining barrier function during infectious and chronic colitis  To examine the role of TVP23 homolog B in intestinal secretory cell differentiation and intestinal regeneration.

Fibroblasts persist in fibrotic lungs and lay down matrix, contributing to a progressive and persistent phenotype in patients. Matrix metalloproteinases (Matrix metalloproteinases) are enzymes that cleave and break down extracellular matrix during wound repair and the degradation and removal of scar tissue is essential for fibrosis resolution. The expression of MMP-9 is increased in the lungs of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. However, MMP-9 is not present in the active form rendering it unable to cleave collagens. Our preliminary data in MMP-9 deficient mice support that active MMP-9 is necessary for fibrosis resolution. We therefore asked if MMP-9 activation is inhibited in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis lungs limiting its ability to successfully initiate repair through matrix degradation. MMP-9 is activated from its latent-form through a series of activating enzymes beginning with urokinase plasminogen activating enzyme (urokinase plasminogen activating enzyme). urokinase plasminogen activating enzyme cleaves plasminogen into plasmin which in turn is a major activator of MMP-9. However, in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) inhibits urokinase plasminogen activating enzyme thus inhibiting the activation cascade needed for downstream MMP-9-activation and matrix degradation. Due to the poor quality and significantly reduced life expectancy associated with interstitial lung diseases, it is becoming increasingly important to identify molecular pathways that are targetable for therapeutic intervention. This proposal seeks to address this unmet need by investigating the central hypothesis that MMP-9 activation by plasmin is necessary for fibrosis resolution and that this pathway can be induced through beneficial TNF-a signaling. Based on our robust preliminary studies, we propose three specific aims to test this central hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that beneficial TNF-a signaling increases urokinase and expression of MMP-9 in fibroblasts. This will be tested using genetic approaches to determine if conditional deletion of MMP-9 in fibroblasts is sufficient to prevent fibrosis resolution in a spontaneously resolving fibrosis model and if exogenous TNF-a is sufficient to activate the urokinase plasminogen activating enzyme/plasminogen/MMP-9 pathway, inducing resolution in a non-resolving fibrosis model. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that MMP-9 activation by plasmin contributes to the resolution of bleomycin-induced fibrosis. This will be tested through the generation of a non-cleavable MMP-9 mutant and through pharmacological inhibition of MMP-9 in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that a clinical formulation of recombinant urokinase (KinlyticTM) promotes the resolution of established pulmonary fibrosis by activating pro-MMP-9 through the plasminogen/plasmin cascade. This will be tested by treating mice with persistent fibrosis with recombinant urokinase to induce plasmin and MMP-9 activation as a mechanism of fibrosis resolution. The proposed studies will provide a novel understanding about how activating an anti-fibrotic pathway (urokinase plasminogen activating enzyme/plasminogen/MMP-9) may contribute to the resolution of fibrosis. Furthermore, the outcomes of these pre-clinical, therapeutic studies will significantly impact our understanding of the mechanisms that control fibrosis resolution.",1,1R01HL173030-01,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",3,4,0,0

We propose to provide a mechanistic understanding of this susceptibility by leveraging 3 key innovations: First, we have developed a 3-dimensional lung culture system that allows for detailed interrogation of the early events in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, we have established an animal model of COVID-19 in mice transgenic for the human ACE2 receptor in our facility. Third, we have built a multi-scale mathematical model of lung infection in COVID-19, that we now seek to expand and personalize to individual hosts. We have two Aims in this project: In Aim 1, we will validate, expand, and personalize our existing multi-scale model, using an unbiased approach to identify and test hypotheses relating to susceptibility to severe COVID-19, and in Aim 2 we will test a specific hypothesis regarding the mechanism of the observed inter-individual heterogeneity in COVID-19 severity, namely that it is, in part, mediated by divergent activation of the mTOR pathway in type I alveolar epithelial cells.

In a classic hierarchical representation framework, signals from peripheral receptor neurons with simple tuning properties are transformed in primary sensory cortex to represent sensory objects. However, recent data suggest that neural activity in primary sensory cortex strongly correlates with behavior, and that sensory representations undergo large scale changes over time. We here test the hypotheses that behavioral tuning of neurons in the olfactory (piriform) cortex supports the ability to filter out signals predicted by behavior, and that coupling odor exposure to behavior stabilizes representational drift. Olfaction is an ideal model system to study sensory-behavior interactions. Mice exhibit a rich repertoire of olfactory-driven behaviors, including behaviors critical for survival and reproduction, and piriform cortex receives direct sensory inputs from the olfactory bulb and is reciprocally interconnected with higher cognitive and motor areas. We have implemented state-of-the-art experimental approaches to chronically record piriform neural activity while synchronously monitoring behaviors. Our preliminary data suggests that sniffing, facial movements, and locomotion can strongly modulate piriform neuronal activity. Aim 1: To determine whether behavioral signals in piriform cortex subserve predictive processingWe will combine two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed mice with detailed behavioral monitoring of sniffing, facial movements including whisking, and locomotion, and we will quantify the extent to which piriform odor responses differ across spontaneously occurring behavioral states. We will then use a closed-loop experimental design to directly test whether behavioral signals in piriform cortex serve to filter out expected sensory information. We predict that neuronal responses to behaviorally coupled odors will decrease over time, while responses to behaviorally uncoupled odors will remain unaltered. Aim 2: To determine whether representational drift in piriform cortex is explained by behavioral change. We will quantify the stability of odor representations in piriform cortex, and we will test the extent to which changes in odor tuning (representational drift) can be explained by changes in behavioral state. We predict that representations of odors that consistently occur during defined behavioral states remain stable over time, while responses to behaviorally uncoupled odors will drift. Successful completion of the proposed project will provide new insight into how animal behavior shapes olfactory processing and the generation of odor representations in the mammalian cortex. Our studies will set the stage for future projects aimed at characterizing the neural circuit mechanisms underlying complex odor-behavior representations in the olfactory cortex, and the investigation of complex olfactory-driven behaviors in freely moving mice in naturalistic environments.",1,1R21DC021540-01A1,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,0,1,5,1

Soccer, the most popular sport on earth, is an aerobic outlet for more than 25 million Americans. The potential benefits of soccer are offset by repetitive subconcussive head impacts (repetitive subconcussive head impacts) from soccer heading. repetitive subconcussive head impacts are associated with exposure-dependent adverse effects on neuroimaging and on cognitive performance, independent of collisions and concussion. The tradeoffs between aerobic benefits and repetitive subconcussive head impacts-related harms are not known. The central aim of this proposal is to examine the aerobic benefits of soccer play, in relation to repetitive subconcussive head impacts harms, for brain structure and function, and to explore person-level factors that modify this risk-benefit tradeoff. Beneficial effects of aerobic capacity and adverse subclinical effects of repetitive subconcussive head impacts can be detected with neuroimaging of white matter. However, little is known about their joint impact on white matter and, in turn, how white matter features mediate effects on cognitive function. Fundamental knowledge on the repetitive subconcussive head impacts risk-benefit balance can inform our understanding of repetitive subconcussive head impacts morbidity and its mitigation beyond the specific context of soccer, such as other sports and combat. Prior work on repetitive subconcussive head impacts effects has not specifically measured aerobic capacity, and little is known about whether and how white matter mediates exposure-outcome associations. Our proposed 2-year longitudinal follow up study of 280 young adults, including soccer players with high (n=70) and low (n=70) exposure to repetitive subconcussive head impacts, non-collision non-athlete controls (n=70 (n=70) and non-athlete controls (n=70), will test the hypothesis that aerobic capacity-engendered benefits confound and modify the adverse effects of repetitive subconcussive head impacts on white matter that, in turn, is a mediator of adverse cognitive effects. We will measure aerobic capacity (VO2max) and repetitive subconcussive head impacts over 2 years and perform Myelin Water and Microstructure MRI of white matter as well as cognitive assessments, at enrollment and 2 years later. We will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: Evaluate the joint effects of VO2max and repetitive subconcussive head impacts on white matter myelination and microstructure. Aim 2: Assess mediation by white matter of the known associations of VO2max and repetitive subconcussive head impacts with cognitive performance. Aim 3: Explore the BDNF-Val66met and ApoE-ε4 gene variants as modifiers of the tradeoff of VO2max and RHSI-mediated effects on white matter. Delineating risk vs. benefit to cognitive performance from soccer can transform perception of risk by stakeholders, facilitate choice and guidance on soccer participation and heading.

This goal is hampered by the fact that, when examined at the single-cell level, this behavior appears largely unpredictable: Genetically identical cells, within a uniform environment, exhibit heterogeneous phenotypes in terms of gene expression, signaling, and consequent fate choice. This cellular individuality is observed throughout biology, from the emergence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria, to cell differentiation in the early mammalian embryo, and numerous other examples. Studies over the last two decades have pinpointed the stochastic origins of cellular individuality, by demonstrating that the inherent randomness (""noise"") of single-molecule events can be amplified into protein number fluctuations at the cellular level. The picture that emerged from those studies is of living cells as ""noisy machines"", incapable of high precision, whose fate choices are subject to significant randomness. But the widespread success of the ""noise"" concept in describing cellular heterogeneity also points to its weakness: It is easy to describe single-cell properties as ""stochastic"" and map them into statistical distributions, but doing so does not mean that we understand the underlying cellular process. On the contrary, by creating a façade of understanding, a stochastic description may impede our efforts to uncover the deterministic factors that drive single-cell behavior. Recent years have seen a growing awareness of this caveat and an increase in efforts to identify the deterministic drivers (so-called ""hidden variables"") of cellular individuality, but it is fair to say that we still lack a satisfactory picture for what drives single-cell behavior even in the simplest systems, to say nothing of more complex ones. Research goal. The choice between rapid cell death (lysis) and viral dormancy (lysogeny), following infection of E. coli by bacteriophage lambda, serves as a paradigm for the way genetic networks drive cell fate decisions, and for the purported role of molecular randomness in this process. Building on our work over the last decade, we will use lambda infection to identify hidden drivers of cellular individuality in gene regulation and fate choice. By revealing how deterministic the decision process is, we aim to establish lambda as a paradigm for preciserather than ""noisy""-cell fate choice. In parallel to the work on lambda, we will continue to develop tools for the manipulation, imaging, analysis, and modeling of individual cells, and apply them in collaborative projects addressing cellular individuality across diverse biological contexts.",5,5R35GM140709-04,PAR-19-367,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,10,2,0

However, meeting the promise of personalized genomic medicine will require accounting for the fact that each individual has a unique life history beginning with development and laden with exposures to diverse environments, and each individual variant exists in the context of millions of other variants.

A critical impediment to drug and regimen development is the lack of metrics of effective treatment response for use in drug discovery and pre-clinical development. Two factors considered crucial to shortening treatment are the capacity of a drug to penetrate and accumulate in lung lesions and the inherent activity of a drug against residual drug-tolerant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) populations that survive initial drug killing. This proposal focuses on the inherent treatment-shortening activity of drugs, independent of PK. Unfortunately, the bacteriological basis of why existing tuberculosis drugs and regimens vary in treatment-shortening activity remains unclear. This project evaluates the basis of drug treatment-shortening activity in tuberculosis, focusing particularly on the role of overall bacterial activity and replication during treatment. Conventionally, drugs are assessed based on the degree to which they lower Mycobacterium tuberculosis burden. Our alternative approach evaluates how drugs affect fundamental bacterial cellular processes. Specifically, we developed an assay that quantifies how drugs affect ongoing ribosomal RNA synthesis called RS ratio. We found tuberculosis drugs and regimens that shorten treatment profoundly suppress rRNA synthesis; whereas drugs with high bactericidal activity but low treatment-shortening activity allow surviving Mycobacterium tuberculosis populations to sustain rRNA synthesis. The RS ratio is already transforming drug development pipelines and clinical trials, but the physiological basis for the predictive power of the RS ratio needs to be fully elucidated. Since the rate of rRNA synthesis is fundamentally correlated with replication rate, we hypothesize that Mycobacterium tuberculosis replication during treatment is an important unrecognized factor in treatment-shortening. Aim 1 will elucidate the effect of diverse drugs on replication while validating the RS ratio as a measure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis replication and establishing a series of confirmatory molecular assays. Aim 2 will test the paradigm in vivo by evaluating pairwise combinations selected based on their potency on inhibiting Mycobacterium tuberculosis replication.

Our long-term goal is to catalyze effective strategies for early intervention by establishing the mechanisms that lead to osteoarthritis. Through genome-wide association studies (genome-wide association studies), it is clear that the genetic risk for osteoarthritis is driven primarily by a large number of non-coding single nucleotide variants (single nucleotide variants) that alter the regulation of gene expression in chondrocytes and other cell types of the joint. Our overall hypothesis is that testing the effect of osteoarthritis genome-wide association studies single nucleotide variants on enhancer strength will identify the most likely causal variants, and that analyzing transcription factor binding at these variants will provide insight into the mechanisms of genetic risk in osteoarthritis. We work with cadaveric chondrocytes from donors with no history of joint disease to provide a regulatory environment that represents cartilage homeostasis. In addition to this baseline state, we also stimulate cells with bioactive matrix fragments to initiate gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes that mimic the cellular state during osteoarthritis. The first aim is to identify expression modulating variants (expression modulating variants) in primary human chondrocytes at baseline and in response to an osteoarthritis-relevant stimulus. We will use massively parallel reporter assays (massively parallel reporter assays) to assess allele-specific activity of the 1259 variants that reside within 104 known osteoarthritis genome-wide association studies loci. The results from massively parallel reporter assays and expression quantitative trait loci (expression quantitative trait loci) studies in other cell types and diseases give us the expectation that we will identify 1-3 expression modulating variants for each of 10-30 loci and that some of these will be specific to either baseline or stimulus conditions. The second aim is to computationally determine the transcription factors that differentially bind to expression modulating variants. We expect to find that expression modulating variants preferentially reside in regions that have accessible chromatin (as determined by ATAC-seq) and contain histone marks present in enhancers (as determined by Cut & Run for H3K27ac). Further, we expect that expression modulating variants will alter transcription factor binding strength and that stimulus-specific expression modulating variants will disrupt the binding sites of transcription factors that we have shown coordinate gene expression changes in response to this stimulus. This proposal is innovative, as it represents the first MPRA in primary human chondrocytes and one of the first ""response massively parallel reporter assays"" to test the effect of cell state on allele-specific enhancer function for any disease.

Senescent cells within joint tissues contribute to osteoarthritis, but there is a knowledge gap regarding the triggers by which decades of aging initiate cellular senescence. One key mediator of senescence in other contexts is persistent DNA damage and the subsequent activation of a set of signaling pathways known as the DNA damage response (DNA damage response). The DNA damage response can drive the production of inflammatory and matrix-degrading molecules collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (senescence-associated secretory phenotype), which has strong overlap with catabolic molecules known to contribute to osteoarthritis. As demonstrated through the use of a single-cell gel electrophoresis ""comet"" assay, chondrocytes accumulate significant levels of DNA damage throughout aging and during osteoarthritis. This damage is mostly in the form of single-strand breaks (single-strand breaks) but a subset of cells also harbor double-strand breaks (double-strand breaks). These distinct forms of damage can be initiated in cells from young cadaveric donors and mice to mimic the levels found in older donors/mice, with methyl methanesulfonate (methyl methanesulfonate) for single-strand breaks, ellipticine for double-strand breaks, and irradiation to generate both single-strand breaks and double-strand breaks. Conversely, the burden of DNA damage in older cadaveric donors and older mice can be reduced by boosting DNA repair with activation of Sirtuin 6 (Sirtuin 6) using the small molecule MDL-800. The long-term goal of this work is to catalyze more effective treatments for osteoarthritis by determining the mechanisms by which joint cells become senescent. The central hypothesis is that the accumulation of DNA damage in joint tissues plays a causal role in driving senescence, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, and subsequent osteoarthritis. The first aim is to establish the contribution of single-strand breaks and double-strand breaks to senescence by applying distinct forms of DNA damage (irradiation, methyl methanesulfonate, ellipticine) to cadaveric human chondrocytes and synovial cells. The second aim is to determine the extent to which DNA damage drives senescence and osteoarthritis in mice. We also use intra-articular injection of agents to increase damage (methyl methanesulfonate or ellipticine) or decrease damage (MDL-800) in the joints of p16tdTom reporter mice to assess senescence and functional/histologic osteoarthritis. The third aim is to define the protein signatures that contribute to progression towards the senescence-associated secretory phenotype using a multiplex antibody staining method known as iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i) to track the signaling pathways that are activated in response to DNA damage. The expected outcomes of this work include a better understanding of the types of DNA damage that lead to senescence in joint tissues and the signaling pathways that link the DNA damage response to senescence-associated secretory phenotype. This work is innovative in that tailored interventions are employed to alter the levels of DNA damage, with sophisticated readouts of senescence, including 4i for assessing protein signatures and senescence reporter mice.

This integration relies on flexible modulation of sensory processing in response to behavioral states like motivation, attention, and arousal. Neurons in the basal forebrain are key mediators of these behavioral states. At the same time, basal forebrain neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease is associated with deficits in both cognitive and sensory processing. Olfactory deficits are especially common across neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, particularly those associated with dementia. While it has been hypothesized that olfaction and cognitive processing are linked by common upstream regulatory systems, the circuit mechanisms mediating this control remain unknown. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of how neural circuits in the basal forebrain impact sensory processing. The proposed Aims test the hypothesis that effects of attention, arousal, and reward prediction on olfactory processing rely on precisely timed, cholinergic signaling within the basal forebrain controlling projection output to the olfactory bulb. In the mentored K99 phase (Aim 1), I will investigate the impact of behavioral state on odor coding in the olfactory bulb using meso-scale, in vivo two-photon imaging. Under the mentorship of Drs. Ben Arenkiel and Paul Pfaffinger, and with the collaboration of Drs. Jacob Reimer and Ankit Patel, I will be trained in the technical aspects of meso-scale two-photon microscopy and computational methods. As I transition to independence in the R00 phase, I will look upstream to processing in the basal forebrain where I will use a combination of electrophysiology, optogenetics, fiber photometry, and targeted genetic manipulations to determine how cell type specific, state-dependent signaling within the basal forebrain influences olfactory learning (Aim 2). Finally, in Aim 3 I will test the hypothesis that basal forebrain cholinergic and GABAergic neurons play distinct roles in olfactory learning, via impacts on odor processing in the olfactory bulb. To test this, I will use a combination of targeted genetic manipulations, olfactory-based behavioral platforms, meso-scale two-photon imaging, and fiber photometry. Together the proposed research will reveal cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying basal forebrain control of olfactory sensory processing in the healthy brain. Ultimately, this addresses the question of how basal forebrain dysfunction impacts sensation and cognition in disease, and it will provide the conceptual framework for a future independent research program.",5,5R00DC019505-04,RFA-NS-19-043,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,0,1,5,1

An influential neuroscience-based heuristic framework, Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment), proposes that to address this heterogeneity, the assessment of addictions should be multi-dimensional and focus on three key domains: executive function (executive function), incentive salience (incentive salience), and negative emotionality (negative emotionality), assessed with comprehensive batteries of self-report and neurobehavioral tasks. While computational tools have increased the knowledge extracted from these tasks, there are surprisingly few high-quality assays for monitoring and characterizing these domains. The burden of administration of current assessment batteries may take up to 10 hours and most assessment instruments lack precision in identifying underlying etiological mechanisms. Critically, most neurobehavioral and neuroimaging tasks have low test-retest reliability, which limits their utility for biomarker discovery. To address these limitations, we propose to apply Bayesian adaptive design optimization (ADO; Myung & Pitt, 2009) to established tasks that index the three Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment domains, with the goal of developing rapid, robust, and reliable neurobehavioral probes of these domains. ADO is a general-purpose computational machine-learning algorithm that optimizes data collection and extracts the maximal information from participant responses in the fewest possible trials. Our preliminary data show that ADO led to 0.95 or higher test-retest reliability of the delay discounting rate in under 1-2 minutes of testing, captured approximately 10% more variance in test-retest reliability, and was 3-5 times more precise and 3-8 times more efficient than conventional assessment methods (Ahn et al., 2020). The current study proposes to develop and evaluate a battery of ADO-based tasks, software, and mobile apps using stateof-the-science computational approaches that will significantly reduce the time for neurocognitive task administration, while increasing task reliability, precision, and efficiency. To capture the heterogeneity of addiction, this battery will be tested with neurotypical individuals and several diverse populations with different types of substance use disorders (opioid, stimulant, alcohol, and tobacco) in three countries (USA, South Korea, Bulgaria) where we have developed infrastructure for this type of research. This value-added perspective would be useful for outof-sample validation of our models and allow us to address not only the generalizability of the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment domains to different types of substance use disorders, but also the cross-cultural generalizability of the domains, which has not been examined. The specific aims of the study are to:  Develop a battery of reliable and efficient ADO-based neurobehavioral tasks of the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment domains and assess its test-retest reliability in neurotypical individuals;  Assess the predictive utility of the newly developed ADO tasks for substance use disorders outcomes by testing patients with different types of substance use disorders; and  Design web-based platforms and mobile apps for measuring cognition with the newly developed ADO tasks, and open-source software platforms with the ADO and other computational methods we develop.",5,5R01DA058038-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,0,1,5,1

Environmental variation can generate genetic tradeoffs both among and within populations, helping to maintain this genetic diversity. I study the genetic mechanisms and architecture of these tradeoffs in nature. My recent research has focused on two central goals: 1) developing approaches for finding the genetic basis of local adaptation and 2) empirical testing of hypotheses about local adaptation and G×E. I propose research to study genetic mechanisms of adaptation to environment using a model system that is convenient for ecological experimentation, Arabidopsis thaliana. This work will test hypotheses about the genetic architecture of adaptation to changing environments through space and time, about how gene flow influences genetic architecture, and about the role of gene expression plasticity in adaptation to variable environments. In all projects, our ability to conduct ecologically realistic but controlled common garden experiments will provide information on genetic variation in environmental responses (G×E) that can be used to interpret observational data from nature. We will first study the genetic mechanisms of adaptation to temporally changing environments. We will study how different populations of have adapted to hundreds of generations of environmental change by sequencing genomes of museum specimens. Second, we will study local adaptation along montane environmental gradients with different levels of isolation to test how gene flow influences the architecture of local adaptation. This project will collect populations from different geographic contexts and conduct experiments to characterize the genetic basis of local adaptation and expression plasticity.

Understanding the mechanisms of neural circuit assembly in the mammalian brain may provide insights into the etiology of human brain disorders. In the mammalian brain, each neuron on average forms connection with thousands of other neurons. The assembly of these complex circuits depends on cell-cell communication during many steps of neural development. In the previous three cycles of this grant, we have developed methods such as Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers) and viral-genetic manipulations in mice that allowed us to label and genetically manipulate specific neuron cell types, down to individual neurons, and study genes that play key roles in dendrite morphogenesis and target selection of axons. Specifically, we have recently identified two cell-surface proteins, Teneurin-3 (Teneurin-3) and Latrophilin-2 (Latrophilin-2), that are expressed in complementary patterns in the interconnected nodes of hippocampal network, following a ""Teneurin-3→Teneurin-3, Latrophilin-2→Latrophilin-2"" connectivity rule . We have shown that Latrophilin-2 acts as a heterophilic repulsive ligand and Teneurin-3 acts as a homophilic attractive ligand to direct Teneurin-3+ proximal CA1 axons to selectively target to distal subiculum; at the same time, Teneurin-3 acts as a repulsive ligand to direct Latrophilin-2+ axons to proximal subiculum. We have also developed a method that allows us to profile cell-surface proteomes with exquisite sensitivity and spatiotemporal control. In this proposal, we will expand on both of these recent advances. Specifically, we will investigate whether Teneurin-3 and Latrophilin-2 instruct wiring specificity in multiple nodes of the extended hippocampal network and in other brain regions, how Teneurin-3-Latrophilin-2 interaction leads to axon repulsion, and whether G protein signaling is essential for Latrophilin-2's action as a receptor or a ligand. Complementary to the in-depth studies of Teneurin-3 and Latrophilin-2, we will use our cell-surface proteomic profiling methods to broadly survey changes of cellsurface proteomes from developing to mature neurons, and to identify new cell-surface proteins that regulate dendrite morphogenesis and neural circuit assembly.",5,5R01NS050835-17,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,13,5,1

The human cortex is generated from a specialized population of outer radial glia neural stem cells (outer radial glia NSCs) in the outer subventricular zone, which divide to produce intermediate neural progenitors (intermediate neural progenitors) that themselves divide to produce 8-12 neurons. Drosophila Type II neural stem cells (T2 neural stem cells) divide in a similar pattern and generate intermediate neural progenitors to produce most neural cells of the central complex (CX)- a conserved brain region across insect species involved in producing complex high-level behavior. Thus, T2 neural stem cells are a good model for investigating the genetic mechanisms of neural diversity adopted by neural progenitors across species. We previously discovered a series of transcription factors (transcription factors) and RNA-binding proteins (RNA-binding proteins) that are sequentially expressed in T2 neural stem cells and intermediate neural progenitors over developmental time. These are ideal candidates for specifying the identity of the CX lineages through combinatorial temporal patterning. Here, using an innate goal-directed behavior in fliesodor-guided food search-associated CX circuit, we will identify which temporally expressed transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins play a role in specifying olfactory navigation circuitry and determine the role of these genes in specifying the number, morphology, and identity of each circuit element (Aim 1). Next, we will use genetic birthdating to determine the lineage and birthtime of each circuit element and to examine the link between birth timing and function in a single T2 NSC lineage-DL1 (Aim 2). Finally, our proposed training, mentoring, and science outreach activities through the Pueblo Brain Science program in New Mexico will target trainees at multiple levels and will improve science education awareness and promote diversity in neuroscience (Aim 3). While investigating mechanisms regulating neural diversity, our long-term goal is to make the neuroscience field diverse through training, mentoring, and promoting science education in resource-limited and historically neglected Pueblo communities. As many of the identified factors have human homologs, our results will identify conserved principles governing the development of CX and provide insights into the development of the human cortex.",1,1R01NS136555-01,PAR-23-122,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,2,13,5,1

Nearly a quarter of protein families are currently dark, where molecular conformation is completely unknown and this gap is likely to expand further with the rapid accumulation of new protein sequences without annotated structures. The key challenge is now how to bridge this gap to gain a comprehensive understanding of biology and disease, thereby paving the way to structure-based drug design at genomic scale. Computational protein modeling plays a key role in this effort due to its scalability and genome-wide applicability. My laboratory focuses on the development and application of novel data-driven computational modeling and refinement methods to increase accuracy and coverage of protein structure prediction on genomic scale irrespective of homology. Future research focuses on improving homology-free protein folding using multiscale de novo modeling driven by deep learning-based inter-residue interactions, enhancing low-homology threading or fold recognition by formulating new algorithms for remote template identification despite low evolutionary relatedness, and developing methods for high-resolution restrained structure refinement guided by generalized ensemble search for driving computational models to near-experimental accuracy. Proteome-wide computational modeling and refinement effort will be conducted, leveraging our unique access to large-scale supercomputing infrastructure, to build high-confidence models covering the dark protein families, which will be organized in a database for public access. This comprehensive database of structural annotations will shed light on the structures, functions, and interactions of the dark proteome, with broad implications in drug discovery and human health. Software and web servers will be freely disseminated to help worldwide community of biomedical researchers to apply these methods to their specific research problems, thus multiplying the impact of computational modeling on basic research in biology and medicine.

Noninvasive in vivo EPR-based spectroscopy and imaging of tissue oxygenation (pO{2}), extracellular pH (pH{e}), redox, glutathione (GSH) and interstitial inorganic phosphate (Pi) provide unique insights into biological processes in the TME, and may serve as a tool for preclinical screening of anticancer drugs and optimizing TME-targeted therapeutic strategies. In this competitive renewal application, our new directions are built on knowledge and discoveries made during the previous funding period. There are two goals of our R01 renewal proposal. First is to further advance paramagnetic probes and magnetic resonance technology with a focus on improving probes biocompatibility, functionality, and developing multifunctional imaging modalities. Second is to utilize these advances and knowledge accumulated using spectroscopic modalities in the initial R01 project period to obtain further insights into the role of TME in cancer progression, and to test our hypothesis on the roles of interstitial inorganic phosphate in tumorigenesis. The specific aims are: (SA1) To advance molecular multifunctional EPR-based imaging technology and paramagnetic probes. The biocompatible derivatives of multifunctional trityl HOPE probe sensitive to acidity (pH{e}), oxygen (pO{2}) and phosphate (Pi) in Extracellular tissue microenvironment, and dual function nitroxide pH & redox probes will be optimized for concurrent multifunctional imaging using cutting edge imaging modalities, rapid scan EPR imaging and Overhauser-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.

Tissue samples from the areas with the chemical TME characteristics of a malignant phenotype will be isolated and the TME study will be complemented with immunohistochemical, biochemical, and genetic tissue analysis, and with measurements of total phosphorus and phosphate (Pi) contents in blood. In summary, the developed multifunctional imaging techniques and probes will broaden the scope of preclinical EPR allowing for mapping of physiologically relevant tissue parameters in various disease models in cancers and beyond.

Disruption of this switch results in infertility and/or aneuploidy. Conserved features of the developmental transition include stem cell self-renewal followed by initiation of the meiotic program (e.g., homologous chromosome pairing, synapsis, double strand break formation) and repression of mitotic cell cycling. Multiple pathways function in control of the switch, resulting in genetic redundancy that has impeded the identification of key regulators. Furthermore, the regulatory process is heavily reliant on posttranscriptional control mechanisms. Studies of this switch in animals have progressed farthest in C. elegans. This is in part because the developmental transitions follow a convenient spatial continuum, allowing facile analysis of changes in cellular state (e.g. levels of regulators, changes in chromosome behavior) in wild type and mutant backgrounds. We have identified three parallel redundant pathways that control the switch in C. elegans. Yet, important questions remain. How is the switch spatially controlled? Here we focus on one of the pathways, the SCFPROM-1 pathway, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions in protein degradation. SCFPROM-1 induces meiotic entry and inhibits mitotic cell cycling, and its activity is controlled by PROM-1 proteins levels that rise from a base in stem cells to a peak at meiotic entry. Proposed studies of the spatial control will uncover how the activity and function of SCFPROM-1 is regulated and is coordinated with the other two known pathways, how meiotic entry is repressed in stem cells, and how mitotic cell cycling is repressed at meiotic entry. What are the missing regulators that execute the switch? The regulatory network contains significant genetic redundancy and there is evidence for missing regulators. Leveraging a novel in vivo genetic system we developed to synchronously switch stem cells to meiotic entry, we are employing genome-wide integrated transcriptomics, translatomics and proteomics, followed by genetic functional analysis to identify missing regulators. This combined genomics and genetically targeted functional analysis will overcome genetic redundancy in the developmental switch, which is difficult in less tractable organisms. Our overall goal is to complete the regulatory network and delineate processes governing an essential step in germline development, which will inform studies in other animals. Our investigations will uncover new developmental, cellular and molecular principles that are important for human health.

In the herpesviruses and many bacteriophages, packaging is catalyzed by a terminase enzyme that utilizes a concatemeric genome substrate. To accomplish this, terminase enzymes assemble into distinct initiation, motor and termination complexes to processively excise an individual genome from the concatemer, and concomitantly package it into the capsid. This requires that the enzymes cycle between stable nuclease and dynamic motor intermediates. While our understanding of packaging initiation and motor translocation is extensive, termination of genome packaging remains ill-studied and poorly characterized in all viruses, primarily because defined experimental systems have not been developed. Phage  is an exception wherein rigorous biochemical assays allow molecular dissection of the entire assembly pathway. This multi-PI application proposes to use phage  to interrogate termination, the final and most poorly characterized step in the packaging pathway. Two fundamental questions central to genome packaging are addressed; (i) how does the translocating motor recognize the genome end while also sensing that a sufficient length of DNA has been packaged, transition to a site-specifically bound nuclease complex, and (ii) how do ""finishing proteins"" promote end maturation and terminase ejection from the nucleocapsid without loss of the tightly packaged DNA. We describe highly integrated and synergistic biochemical, biophysical, single-molecule and structural approaches to characterize this conserved and essential, yet largely unstudied step in virus assembly. Given that this process is strongly conserved in all of the double-stranded DNA viruses, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, and the commonality of initiation-translocation-termination pathways in biology, the results will have broad implications in virology and cell biology.",5,5R01GM127365-06,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,9,11,1,3

Dually eligible individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (and related dementias) are exceptionally vulnerable under this fragmented care system. They often need extensive acute care (paid by Medicare) and long-term care (paid by Medicaid) but experience functional and cognitive declines, which compound the challenges of navigating the complex, bifurcated systems of Medicare and Medicaid. Integrating Medicaid-paid long-term care into Medicare services (termed ""long-term care integration"" hereafter) can improve care coordination for dually eligible individuals with and related dementias. Under long-term care integration, people receive Medicaid-paid long-term care and Medicare services from the same insurance company. In this case, the single company bears financial risk for both Medicare services and Medicaid longterm care and is therefore incentivized to coordinate Medicare services and Medicaid long-term care. A common mechanism for long-term care integration is the dual-eligible special needs plan (dual-eligible special needs plan). Long-term care integration occurs through dual-eligible special needs plans in two ways. First, some dual-eligible special needs plans bear financial risk for both Medicare services and Medicaid long-term care (which we refer to as ""single-capitated dual-eligible special needs plans""). Second, people can receive Medicare services from a dual-eligible special needs plan and long-term care from a separate managed care plan, both of which are operated by the same parent insurance company (which we refer to as ""aligned dual-eligible special needs plan""). dual-eligible special needs plans is a significant force in long-term care integration, with substantial increases in enrollments in single-capitated or aligned dual-eligible special needs plans over the past decade. Recognizing their importance, Congress permanently authorized and refined the utilization of the dual-eligible special needs plan for long-term care integration in 2018. However, this rapid adoption of the dual-eligible special needs plan for long-term care integration lacks rigorous empirical evidence. Our long-term goal is to provide a rigorous empirical evaluation of single-capitated and aligned DSNPs, ultimately supporting evidence-based policies that can improve outcomes for dually eligible individuals with and related dementias. Leveraging 2018-2024 Medicare claims linked with Medicaid claims, this proposal will adopt a staggered difference-in-differences approach to obtain the causal effects of single-capitated and aligned DSNPs on key outcomes.

Second, we assess the effect of aligned dual-eligible special needs plans and compare the effect of aligned vs single-capitated DSNPs. Third, we assess the effect of aligned dual-eligible special needs plans by plan characteristics.

Clinicians are under pressure to make rapid treatment decisions, usually without real-time diagnostic information that reliably differentiates patients with bacterial pneumonia from other conditions with similar clinical presentations. While time to effective treatment is a critical determinant of clinical outcome, many patients with pneumonia receive inadequate empiric antibiotics due to rising rates of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pneumonia pathogens. In contrast to bloodstream, gastrointestinal, or urinary tract infections, the lung is a particularly challenging space to access without invasive diagnostic procedures. We have established proof of concept in murine models that there are clear, bacterial species-specific breath volatile metabolite signatures in pneumonia, and that microbial breath volatile metabolites have markedly different responses to antibiotic exposure within a few hours in phenotypically susceptible vs. non-susceptible organisms.

Our primary objective of this competitive renewal is to define, in vivo, the immediate consequences of oncogenic mutations in BRAF during Serrated colon cancer formation. We will pursue these studies in colon stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin of colon cancer. Work from the previous grant identified new genetic modifiers of Serrated tumorigenesis. We found that oncogenic BRAFV600E mutations paradoxically cause stem cells to differentiate rather than form tumors. However, when we inactivated tumor suppressor transcription factors CDX2 or SMAD4, Serrated tumorigenesis was markedly restored. Excitingly, we found that CDX2 and SMAD4 target genes can be used to stratify human patients for their susceptibility to Serrated tumors. The logical extension of these studies is to understand the molecular mechanisms that occur in stem cells in response to BRAFV600E mutations. We will focus on the downstream transcriptional effector of BRAF, pERK, and will leverage the genetic mouse models we created to address the following Aims: Our previous work found that the transcription factor CDX2 preserves mature colon identity, with fetalspecific chromatin regions opening upon CDX2-loss. We predict that pERK takes advantage accessible chromatin upon CDX2 loss. Aim 1 will compare the activity of pERK in wild type stem cells, and BRAFV600E or CDX2-mutant stem cells. State-of-the-art -omics approaches will allow first-of-a-kind measurements of pERK on stem cell chromatin, within hours after the BRAFV600E mutation is expressed from its endogenous locus. We will measure pERK binding activity, nuclear localization, and dynamic interactions with its protein partners. Aim 2 will look at the downstream gene regulatory consequences of the BRAFV600E mutation in stem cells lacking SMAD4. We previously demonstrated that SMAD4 loss predisposes mice to Serrated tumor formation, and SMAD4 is frequently mutated in human tumors. We predict that SMAD4 works with pERK to promote differentiation and suppress stem cell renewal. Epigenomics approaches will map pERK binding to the genome, and ATAC-seq and RNA-seq will profile changes to chromatin and the transcriptome. Finally, Aim 3 will functionally test a model that the injury/repair cycle in the colon can create a susceptible environment for BRAF-pERK to drive tumorigenesis, with the prediction that an altered transcriptional network is permissive to Serrated tumor formation during the injury/repair cycle. These studies would provide important pre-clinical models to help explain and test therapeutic strategies to suppress Serrated tumor initiation in humans. These studies are innovative with cutting edge -omics applications and GEMMs and significant in exploring untested mechanisms of oncogenic pERK in stem cells. Successful completion of these studies will have us poised to test therapeutic strategies for the prevention or early detection of Serrated Colon Cancer.",5,5R01CA190558-07,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

This gap means that regulatory bodies and third-party payers do not have a ""common denominator"" that they can use to compare the impact of mental health symptoms and treatment options across all mental health and physical health (physical health) conditions. For example, we cannot effectively compare the overall impact of treatment for depression to treatment for other mental health conditions such as schizophrenia, or to physical health conditions such as diabetes. Quality measurement also underpins cost-effectiveness research, and as a result we cannot accurately allocate resources needed for a nationwide mental health strategy. Furthermore, clinicians and researchers cannot recommend treatments based on overall impact, but rather they are restricted to narrowly focused symptom and outcome measurements. Without addressing problems in outcome-focused quality measures, patients will continue to face a disjointed mental health care system where sufficient resources are not apportioned to their needs, their clinicians cannot select treatments in a way that will maximize their overall functioning, and research to improve their care cannot consistently demonstrate comparative effectiveness. Quality of life (Quality of life) measures provide a promising approach to serve as a common denominator for outcomefocused quality measurement across conditions. However, current nomothetic approaches are not specific to mental health symptoms, which creates measurement insensitivity and substantially reduces measurement accuracy. There are also many idiographic Quality of life measures that are tailored to specific disorders, but they are not directly comparable across mental health or physical health conditions. New Quality of life measurement approaches are needed that are both nomothetically comparable across disease conditions and ideographically tailored to mental health phenomenology. New developments in unsupervised machine learning (machine learning) are well suited to address these limitations in Quality of life measurement. Specifically, we will use recent advances in mixture modeling to create a new personalized Quality of life measurement approach that simultaneously produces both nomothetic and idiographic results. The proposed project is significant and impactful because it eliminates a critical bottleneck to efforts by policy makers, researchers, and clinicians. Results from this work will allow all of these stakeholders to better discern differential impact among mental health conditions and interventions. As a result, they will be able to better serve patients who experience mental health difficulties. This project is also scientifically and methodologically innovative. It creatively uses new developments in unsupervised machine learning to implement a new measurement process while minimizing disruption to current practices. Overall, the proposed project will provide a new standard for outcome-focused measurement of mental health care.",1,1R01MH137075-01,RFA-MH-23-265,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,1,3,3,2

Compared to sighted children, blind children may learn more words from speech because they do not casually perceive writing in their environment and often experience reading delays. They may also learn fewer words from direct perceptual experience because they cannot acquire the meanings of words by perceiving their referents visually. Cumulatively, these word learning differences may affect the trajectory of vocabulary development in early and middle childhood. An improved understanding of vocabulary development could improve education for this underserved population. Unfortunately, word learning and vocabulary are understudied within the area of blind children's language development. This observational analytic study employing a cross-sectional design directly compares self-reported modes (perceptual or linguistic) and channels (spoken or written) of word learning for individual words in blind and sighted children. It also compares their trajectories of vocabulary development from age 5 to 12. Specific aims are 1) Determine whether vocabulary development in blind children is delayed relative to sighted children; 2) Examine whether mode and channel of word learning in blind children differ from those in sighted children; and 3) Present a dataset of age-of-acquisition (age-of-acquisition), mode-ofacquisition (mode-ofacquisition), and channel-of-acquisition (channel-of-acquisition) norms for future use in research. The approach is innovative because objective age-of-acquisition norms (obtained from children themselves rather than subjective adult estimates) are more reliable and valid than subjective norms and are exceptionally rare. The verbal administration of tasks that are typically administered visually will make them accessible not only to blind children, but to any child with a reading or learning disability. Finally, the virtual approach to data collection will allow the researchers to reach more individuals from a population that is historically difficult to study. The project is an instrumental part of the PI's long-term goal of understanding how vocabulary develops without sight and applying this understanding to improve educational strategies and outcomes in blind children.",5,5R16EY036101-02,PAR-21-173,NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE,0,1,5,1

The longitudinal observation of the clinical course that is often needed to classify diabetes causes harmful delays in the correct treatment. Mistakes in diagnosis and treatment may contribute to the higher frequency of diabetic complications in racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, there is a critical need for robust criteria that can be applied at diagnosis to inform clinical decisions in children of all racial/ethnic backgrounds. The long-term objective is to characterize pediatric diabetes at onset to inform clinical management in a timely fashion and thus, ultimately improve outcomes in racially/ethnically diverse children. As preliminary data, the applicants have developed and validated type 1 diabetes (type 1 diabetes) Genetic Risk Scores (Genetic Risk Scores) that, in adults with unclear diabetes, identify those with type 1 diabetes, defined by rapid insulin dependence; and have also demonstrated that a type 1 diabetes GRS improves the current predictive model for progression to type 1 diabetes in individuals at risk. The central hypothesis of this application is that type 1 diabetes Genetic Risk Scores, in combination with islet autoantibodies and other factors at diabetes onset, can be used in racially/ethnically diverse children to identify those who have type 1 diabetes, defined by rapid loss of C-peptide (measure of beta-cell function), as this is the type 1 diabetes characteristic with the largest clinical impact. The rationale for this proposal is that timely characterization of diabetes, which is particularly difficult in minority children, will facilitate early establishment of the correct treatment, improve diabetes outcomes and lower the costs of diabetes, which are currently over $327 billion yearly. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested in racially/ethnically diverse children with diabetes by assessing the ability of type 1 diabetes Genetic Risk Scores, in combination with other factors, to identify those who have type 1 diabetes, defined as insulin deficiency (low C-peptide), in a cross-sectional (Specific Aim 1) and prospective (Specific Aim 2) manner. This project is significant because it is ultimately expected to improve the treatment of pediatric diabetes and thus its clinical outcomes, with particular impact on disadvantaged racial/ethnic groups. This project is innovative because it seeks to shift the current clinical and research practices by proposing to utilize genetics as a novel, affordable, time-independent strategy to diagnose type 1 diabetes, identified by a clinically relevant characteristic.",5,5R01DK124395-04,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,14,2,3,0

Decades of research and drug development have shown that these diseases and disorders can be treated using drugs that modulate neurotransmitter availability. Many of these therapeutics block neurotransmitter reuptake or antagonize receptor signaling by acting on plasma membrane transporters and receptors. Unfortunately, many highly addictive substances such as amphetamines also bind to these proteins, but their mode of action is poorly understood and thus we are unable to combat their deadly effects. Synaptic vesicles (Synaptic vesicles) store neurotransmitter in presynaptic neurons, which are released into the synapse to propagate neuronal signaling. SV transport proteins are also required for neurotransmitter release as they load neurotransmitter into Synaptic vesicles, rendering them fundamental components in the regulation of neurotransmitter signaling. Despite their importance, we still know very little about the underlying molecular mechanisms of SV transporter function. Our work aims at providing a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SV transporter function. Unfortunately, nearly all SV transporters have been recalcitrant to biochemical and biophysical characterization and thus far, most have eluded high-resolution atomic investigations by any structural methodology. Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (Vesicular monoamine transporter 2) is the only transporter expressed in the central nervous system that loads biogenic amine containing neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine into Synaptic vesicles. To tackle SV transport-associated diseases head-on, we will perform detailed structural and functional analysis on Vesicular monoamine transporter 2, revealing its structure in several conformational states representing key intermediates in the transport cycle. The studies proposed here will illuminate the molecular mechanisms of Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 in neurons and reveal the structural basis for how inhibitors and substrates bind. We will address these objectives by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Structural studies of Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 in complex with the inhibitor tetrabenazine; 2) Determine the structural basis of reserpine inhibition; 3) Demonstrate how neurotransmitter and amphetamines are transported by Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 by determining structures in various substrate-bound and apo conformational states. Our anticipated results promise to deepen our understanding of neurotransmitter binding and membrane transport mechanisms and provide necessary atomic information about this family of proteins, localization of the molecular determinants, and modes of drug interaction to guide the development of new inhibitors with fewer side effects and greater specificity.",1,1R01NS134558-01,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

Although they experience severe health disparities associated with substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, depression and suicide, few evidence-based prevention interventions address their distinctive needs. Family disruption, stresses due to migration and poverty, and cultural and social losses are often implicated in adverse health outcomes for urban Indian/Alaska Native families. By improving effective parenting skills and overall family functioning, culturally grounded parenting interventions enable parents to model and promote their children's well-being and reduce their children's vulnerability to risk behaviors. The proposed study extends the project team's prior research on a culturally grounded parenting intervention for urban Indian/Alaska Natives, Parenting in 2 Worlds (Parenting in 2 Worlds), which was co-developed with a coalition of urban Indian non-profit organizations, tested in three Arizona cities, and demonstrated efficacious. The research team joins two Indian/Alaska Native and two non-Indian/Alaska Native investigators, who together have extensive experience conducting collaborative research with Indian/Alaska Native populations in urban and tribal settings. This proposed multi-regional study will create new knowledge in four areas. First, the study will test Parenting in 2 Worlds's effectiveness beyond Arizona in improving parenting and family functioning, among a wider and more diverse group of urban Indian/Alaska Native communities located in cities spread across four regions: Northeast (Buffalo/Niagara), Midwest (St. Paul/Minneapolis), Mountain (Denver), and Southwest (Phoenix). Through the auspices of collaborating urban Indian center partners, the trial will recruit 720 families of Indian/Alaska Native youth age 12-17 (180 per city) and individually randomize them to receive Parenting in 2 Worlds or an informational family health curriculum. Second, the study will test for moderators of the effectiveness of Parenting in 2 Worlds, whether desired outcomes vary by the level of socioeconomic vulnerability, experiences of historical loss, or Indian/Alaska Native cultural identity of the parent participants. Third, the study will expand on the original Arizona trial to examine the adolescent's reports on family functioning and an enlarged range of youth health behaviors potentially impacted by the Parenting in 2 Worlds intervention, including mental health (depressive symptoms, suicidality) as well as substance use and risky sexual behaviors. Fourth, the study will test for mediation-whether positive changes in parenting and family functioning that result from Parenting in 2 Worlds lead to changes in the youth health behaviors. This would be the first crosssite multiregional trial of a culturally grounded parenting intervention designed specifically for urban Indian/Alaska Natives. It will advance critical knowledge on community prevention interventions for an under-served group severely affected by health disparities, and establish whether urban Indian centers and their communities can readily employ Parenting in 2 Worlds to strengthen urban Indian/Alaska Native families and promote the behavioral health of their youth. It will also provide a foundation for advancing knowledge on effective prevention interventions in urban Indian/Alaska Native communities that have different migration histories and tribal compositions.",5,5R01DA056417-03,PAR-20-238,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,6,5,3,2

Although most of the work in this area is correlational in nature, it is often interpreted as if it is causal. Genetically informed research methods can allow researchers to rule-out causal explanations for epidemiological associations and/or identify effects that may be consistent with a causal influence. Using co-twin control methods and a comprehensive new data collection in the Washington State Twin Registry (Washington State Twin Registry), this grant brings together a diverse and established scientific team to examine a series of unanswered questions around social relationships, health, and cognitive functioning, all of which center on causal inference. The work in this proposal is guided by three Specific Aims that will:  Conduct a detailed assessment of social relationship functioning in the Washington State Twin Registry and use these variables in co-twin analyses of health and health behaviors. We will conduct a new data collection on 1,000 adult twin pairs (N = 2,000) in the Washington State Twin Registry and complete a ""deep phenotyping"" of key relationship quality variables, including social integration, relationship satisfaction/quality, and attachment styles. Under Aim 1, we will also collect DNA methylation data and use a series of epigenetic clocks to characterize accelerated biological aging among our main study outcomes;  Conduct a detailed neuropsychological assessment of cognitive functioning in the Washington State Twin Registry cohort and use these variables as key outcomes in co-twin models. Social isolation and loneliness may hasten declines in cognitive functioning, but are these associations consistent with a causal effect? We will conduct detailed neuropsychological assessments of the 2,000 Washington State Twin Registry participants using assessments that target cognitive outcomes shown to be associated with accelerated cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; and  Examine the association between objective measures of daily social functioning and the health and cognitive outcomes in the Washington State Twin Registry. The Electronically Activated Recorder (Electronically Activated Recorder) is a smartphone application that records ambient sounds in participants' daily lives and provides a means of assessing social behaviors beyond self-report alone. We will collect Electronically Activated Recorder data from a sub-sample of 140 adult MZ twin pairs discordant for marital status (N = 280) from the Washington State Twin Registry to determine if within twin-pair differences in the objective indices of social integration are associated with the health, health behavior, and cognitive outcomes.

In addition to circulating renin angiotensin system, components of renin angiotensin system are also expressed in different tissues including the eye. Local renin angiotensin system dysfunction contributes to tissue pathophysiology and end-organ damage in diabetes. However, the exact mechanisms by which ocular renin angiotensin system contribute to retinal pathophysiology in diabetes are still not well-understood. Prorenin, a precursor of the active renin, the rate-limiting enzyme in renin angiotensin system cascade, is highly elevated plasma of diabetic patients and ocular fluid of DR patients. The discovery of its receptor, pro/renin receptor (pro/renin receptor), provided a mechanistic link of elevated prorenin in pathogenesis of DR. Activation of this pathway has been shown to increase Angiotensin II production at tissue level, as well as direct activation of downstream signaling independent of Angiotensin II action, both of which contribute to end-organ damage. In addition to function as a crucial component of renin angiotensin system, pro/renin receptor is an integral component of vacuolar H+-ATPase (vacuolar H+-ATPase), which plays central roles in the acidification of intracellular compartments and cellular pH homeostasis. pro/renin receptor also acts an adaptor protein between the Wnt signaling complex and vacuolar H+-ATPase. Moreover, a soluble form of pro/renin receptor (spro/renin receptor) is produced by protease-mediated cleavage and is elevated under various pathological conditions including DR. Increasing evidence implicates a pathological role of elevated spro/renin receptor; however, the mechanisms by which spro/renin receptor contribute to pathogenesis of these conditions are still not fully understood. We hypothesize that elevated prorenin, pro/renin receptor and its soluble form (spro/renin receptor) contribute to pathogenesis of DR by multiple pathways, leading to local renin angiotensin system activation, as well as signaling events independent of Angiotensin II action. The goal of this proposal is to  determine the mechanisms of prorenin-induced, pro/renin receptor-mediated signaling pathways in pathogenesis of DR;  determine whether elevated spro/renin receptor mediate prorenin-stimulated effects and activates Angiotensin II-dependent pathways in the retina; and  determine the effects and mechanisms of prorenin and spro/renin receptor on vacuolar H+-ATPase function and associated cellular processes. Collectively, the proposed studies will determine the mechanism(s) and signaling pathways by which prorenin, pro/renin receptor, and its soluble form contribute to retinal neurovascular dysfunction in diabetes.

In premature infants, the standard of care for many decades has included the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the first hours of life as treatment for a presumptive diagnosis of early onset sepsis. However, nearly all preterm infants receiving these antibiotics do not actually have sepsis. This grant renewal application proposes an ancillary microbiome study linked to the NICU Antibiotics and Outcomes (NICU Antibiotics and Outcomes) Trial, a recently launched clinical trial that will challenge this longstanding practice of immediately prescribing antibiotics to newborn preterm infants. NICU Antibiotics and Outcomes will test the hypothesis that antibiotics at birth worsens outcomes in preterm infants that are clinically stable. This multicenter trial, which is led by members of our research team, will randomize 802 premature infants to receive intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin or a saline placebo control. The study will measure the impact of variables including mode of delivery, gestational age, sex, and receipt of maternal milk, and administration of maternal antepartum antibiotics. Infant fecal samples in the first month of life as well as maternal fecal and vaginal swabs will be collected in NICU Antibiotics and Outcomes for basic microbiome profiling in the antibiotics and placebo groups using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Here, we propose to augment microbiome analyses of NICU Antibiotics and Outcomes study subjects using novel strain-level metagenomic strategies and by analyzing samples beyond the first month of life. With this strategy, we propose to Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that empiric antibiotics (empiric antibiotics) disrupts mother-infant strain sharing in preterm infants. Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that empiric antibiotics increases the abundance of gut bacterial antimicrobial resistance genes in preterm infants. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that empiric antibiotics delays the transition from a gut ecosystem dominated by facultative anaerobes to one dominated by obligate anaerobes. Because NICU Antibiotics and Outcomes is a first-of-its-kind clinical trial evaluating antibiotic therapy during the first days of life, this ancillary study will provide a rare opportunity to ask and answer a unique set of questions about the biology of early gut bacterial colonization.",5,5R01AI092531-14,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

However, forces also need to be controlled in harmony with motion when interacting with objects and research has rarely focused on how the motor system coordinates both together. The simultaneous variation of force and motion is incorporated in the definition of impedance. Our current neural models do not describe impedance encoding, which limits our understanding of object interaction, an important aspect of human behavior. The proposed research will develop new models of motor cortical impedance encoding during object interaction. Using these new models to decode ongoing impedance signaling, we will substantiate an advanced theory of impedance control used by the motor system to produce accurate object displacement in response to the forces applied by the hand. This research bridges the expertise of Dr. Schwartz in neurophysiology and of Dr. Hogan in robot control. Monkey subjects will perform tasks with real and virtual tools that naturally encourage the use of impedance control. We will record the activity of motor cortical neurons during these tasks and develop new mathematical models to describe the relation between neural activity and force, motion and impedance. Results from electromyography recordings, joint angle measurements and torque calculations, together with the neural models, will be used to better understand how impedance is regulated at the level of muscles and joints. Contributions of stretch reflexes to impedance will be studied and compared to the predictive impedance signaling decoded from motor cortex. This work promises to extend our understanding of the neural control principles governing the way we use our arms and hands to interact with our surroundings. These principles can be used to build new theories of the cognitive processes used to predict and effect changes in the world around us. At the same time, elucidation of the neural and mechanical details of forceful interaction will lead to new rehabilitative and neural prosthetic approaches to paralysis.",5,5R01NS111148-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

One example is hepatic fibrinogen storage disease (hepatic fibrinogen storage disease), where the underlying cause is the endoplasmic reticulum (endoplasmic reticulum) retention and aggregation of fibrinogen mutants, leading to liver damage, hypofibrinogenemia, and excessive bleeding. However, the molecular events underlying the biogenesis and quality control of, both wildtype and mutant fibrinogen, in the endoplasmic reticulum remain unknown. In the preliminary data of this application, we serendipitously found that the biogenesis of fibrinogen is regulated by the Sel1L-Hrd1 protein complex of the principal endoplasmic reticulum quality-control machinery, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (endoplasmic reticulumAD). Sel1L-Hrd1 endoplasmic reticulumAD represents the most evolutionarily conserved branch of endoplasmic reticulumAD and targets misfolded endoplasmic reticulum proteins for cytosolic proteasomal degradation. Hepatocyte-specific Sel1L-deficient mice exhibit fibrinogen-containing inclusions in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, hepatic damage and hypofibrinogenemia, resembling human patients with hepatic fibrinogen storage disease. Indeed, both wildtype and disease-causing mutants of fibrinogens are degraded by Sel1L-Hrd1 endoplasmic reticulumAD. These data point to a critical role of hepatocyte Sel1L-Hrd1 endoplasmic reticulumAD in fibrinogen biogenesis and live homeostasis. Hence, the overarching hypothesis of this application is that Sel1L-Hrd1 endoplasmic reticulumAD is a critical regulatory mechanism for fibrinogen biogenesis, coagulation and liver homeostasis by targeting misfolded, either wildtype or mutant, fibrinogen proteins for proteasomal degradation. This action of endoplasmic reticulumAD towards fibrinogen prevents the formation of toxic fibrinogen inclusions and aggregates in the liver. We will accomplish two Aims:  Demonstrate the significance and molecular mechanism of hepatic Sel1L-Hrd1 endoplasmic reticulumAD in coagulation and fibrinogen biogenesis; and  Delineate the pathological importance of Sel1L-Hrd1 endoplasmic reticulumAD in hepatic fibrinogen storage disease. Completion of these studies will not only delineate the significance and molecular mechanism underlying the endoplasmic reticulumAD function in early biogenesis of fibrinogen, but also have broader impact on the mechanism and therapeutical strategy for other conformational diseases associated with protein misfolding.",5,5R01DK132068-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,5,7,2,0

While disrupted DMN deactivations have been associated with a broad range of psychiatric and neurological conditions, mechanisms underlying such reduced functional magnetic resonance imaging signals remain elusive, hindering their potential use as an imaging marker for disease diagnosis and treatment. The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms underlying stimulus-driven functional magnetic resonance imaging de-activations in DMN. To achieve this goal, we will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging with a novel functional PET framework and cutting-edge 3D functional MR spectroscopy imaging to enable concurrent measures of functional magnetic resonance imaging signals, blood flow, glucose and oxygen metabolism, gamma-aminobutyric acid (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and glutamate levels within a single imaging session.

We will further leverage the sufficient spatial coverage and high sensitivity of our multi-modal framework to assess how the characterized functional magnetic resonance imaging de-activation model varies in space and across subjects. Outcomes of this study will illuminate the metabolic and neurotransmitter processes contributing to task-evoked DMN de-activations, providing testable hypotheses on their disruptions in various mental illnesses.

Although these studies show that orexin-1 receptor (OxR1) signaling is particularly involved in the motivation for many drugs of abuse, none have linked this system to the persistent, chronically relapsing nature of addiction. Here, we extend studies from the previous terms of this project to tackle this important issue. We recently found that the intermittent access (intermittent access) cocaine self-administration paradigm produces a strong, multiphenotype addiction-like state as well as increased numbers of orexin-expressing neurons. Importantly we find that the intermittent access-induced increase in addiction behaviors and orexin expression are persistent (>30d of abstinence). We also find that chronic administration of an OxR1 antagonist during intermittent access blocks the increased demand that this paradigm normally produces. Here, we propose to more fully characterize the intermittent access-linked addiction profile and induced-orexin neurons following 30d abstinence. We also will examine the contribution of OxR1 and OxR2 signaling in ventral tegmental and paraventricular thalamus (PVT (ventral tegmental and paraventricular thalamus (PVT) and paraventricular thalamus (paraventricular thalamus), two reward-related and paraventricular thalamus (PVTs previously linked to orexin function, in persistent addiction behaviors after intermittent access. Finally, we will test whether the FDA-approved dual orexin receptor antagonist, BelsomraTM (suvorexant), is effective in acutely decreasing addiction behaviors, and in preventing the transition from a moderate to a severe addiction profile. Together, the proposed experiments are a natural and important extension of the prior studies in this project and will represent an important step forward in the development of an orexin-based treatment for cocaine addiction.",5,5R01DA006214-34,PA-18-060,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,0,1,8,1

Several natural products of significantly high value to human life (e.g., antibiotics, pharmaceuticals like Artemisinin, anticancer agents like Taxol (paclitaxel) among others) have been produced by organisms that are not optimal for industrial production. Although some of these natural products can be chemically synthesized, the complex structures of several of these compounds makes chemical synthesis difficult and commercially infeasible. As a result, there is increasing need to develop sustainable and readily tractable technological platforms to synthesize these drugs and pharmaceutical intermediates. The central objective of this proposal is to develop a sustainable technological platform that harnesses light energy and biocatalysis to synthesize molecules of significant relevance to human life. We envision doing this by establishing cyanobacterial endosymbionts within yeasts cells, such that the endosymbiotic cyanobacteria provide ATP and assimilated carbon (generated from photosynthesis) to the yeast cells, which utilize it to produce biologically important natural products. This platform will allow us to couple the remarkable biosynthetic and biocatalytic potential of yeast to the photosynthetic ability of cyanobacteria to develop a sustainable and simple bioproduction platform to produce natural products of significant value to human life (vide infra). Premise: (i) Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been recently harnessed to produce high titers of biologically important molecules such as amorphadiene and artemisinic acid, (precursors to Artemisinin) and taxadiene (a key precursor to Taxol), (ii) we had previously developed model endosymbiosis between S. cerevisiae /E. coli to study mitochondrial evolution are currently engineering yeast/cyanobacteria endosymbiosis (preliminary data in Specific Aim 1) and (in Specific Aim 1) and) our preliminary data on engineering model yeast/cyanobacteria endosymbiosis.

We will expand this platform by engineering novel cyanobacterial mutants as putative endosymbionts. We will extensively characterize the engineered yeast/cyanobacteria endosymbiosis to develop strategies to improve their stability, growth rate and homogeneity. (ii) We will create a metabolite-driven synthetic communication system to control endosymbiosis and optimize our platform for metabolic engineering. (in Specific Aim 1) and) We will utilize our photosynthetic endosymbiotic platform to produce key precursors of FDA approved compounds, Artemisinin and Taxol. These studies will be the first step towards our long-term goal of developing a photosynthetic and genetically tractable endosymbiotic platform for the bioproduction of biologically important novel natural products as well as molecules like biopolymers and biofuels.",5,5R01GM139949-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

Acupuncture is a safe and holistic treatment known to relieve cancer-related symptoms, including psychoneurological symptoms. However, its role and mechanism in treating multiple psychoneurological symptoms simultaneously remains unclear. Metabolomics can reveal systematic metabolic changes and time-effect relationships between an intervention and the targeted disease. Metabolomic studies suggest that the tryptophan (Trp)-kynurenine ((Trp)-kynurenine) metabolic pathway plays a critical role in psychoneurological symptoms among cancer survivors. It remains unknown whether the effect of acupuncture on psychoneurological symptoms is associated with regulation of the inflammation-induced activation of the Trp-(Trp)-kynurenine pathway or is associated with other novel pathways. This R21's innovative approach to these outstanding questions involves performing an integrated analysis of breast cancer survivors' serum and fecal metabolome and microbiome before and after an acupuncture intervention. The goal is to understand the effect and mechanism of acupuncture in treating the psychoneurological symptom cluster among breast cancer survivors. The specific aims are:  to evaluate whether a 5-week acupuncture intervention decreases the severity of the psychoneurological symptom cluster (a composite score of pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance), as well as each of the 3 individual psychoneurological symptoms, among breast cancer survivors;  to determine whether the hypothesized decrease in the severity of the psychoneurological symptom cluster and each psychoneurological symptom following acupuncture is associated with changes in targeted Trp-(Trp)-kynurenine pathway metabolites; and  to explore associations between changes in untargeted biomarkers in the serum and fecal metabolome and gut microbiome and the changes in the psychoneurological symptom cluster and each psychoneurological symptom. We hypothesize that acupuncture will reduce the psychoneurological symptom cluster through the Trp-(Trp)-kynurenine metabolomic pathway and will also influence and produce other beneficial changes in the metabolome and microbiome. This integration of large-scale metabolomics and microbiome markers with psychoneurological symptom phenotypes will advance a mechanistic understanding of acupuncture and identify novel biomarkers that could be used in future studies of personalized acupuncture approaches to symptom management and relief among breast cancer survivors.",5,5R21CA277153-02,PAR-20-292,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,1,3,3,2

Apathy is common in persons with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's diseaseRD with prevalence rates up to 72%. It is associated with further cognitive decline, functional deficits, reduced quality of life, social isolation, and increased mortality. Apathy imposes significant burden on long term care staff and negatively impact quality of care, staff satisfaction and turnover. Since few pharmacologic options exist, a major strategy is to foster older adults' engagement in social, physical and cognitive activities, primarily those that are multimodal in nature. However, these interventions often require significant personnel time and resources, a major concern given the current nursing shortage and high turnover among long term care nursing personnel. The Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates long term care facilities to provide meaningful engaging activities for residents, which can be resource intensive and are difficult for many US long term care settings. In order to partially mitigate some of these issues, intervention based on an intelligent socially assistive robot (socially assistive robot) based architecture, called Adaptive Robot-mediated Intervention Architecture (Adaptive Robot-mediated Intervention Architecture), developed under a R21 grant, that can adaptively and dynamically interact with older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's diseaseRD who reside in long term care settings, is proposed in this grant application. This interdisciplinary proposal is directly aligned with the NIA goals of understanding and developing effective interventions using smart technology to reduce the burden of age-related diseases and address the special caregiver needs of those caring for persons with dementia (persons with dementia). This multi-phase, multi-site, mixed methods clinical trial will systematically examine responsiveness and engagement among persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment or dementia to two types of socially assistive robots (humanoid and animal), its effect on cognitive, physical and social function as well as the impact of socially assistive robots on informal and formal caregivers with a goal towards future scalability and sustainability. The specific aims of the proposed research are: Aim 1: To improve our novel social robotic interaction architecture through additional software development to a) make it more versatile in combining multimodal quantitative data capturing engagement, b) more robust such that non-experts can operate it and create new tasks by concatenating task primitives, and c) expand tasks to address varying degrees of cognitive and physical impairments of older adults (Months 1-18). Aim 2: To compare the effect of usual care (usual care) group to usual care+Adaptive Robot-mediated Intervention Architecture group on reducing apathy among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (Mild Cognitive Impairment), mild dementia, or moderate dementia (Months 19-48). Aim 3: To identify barriers and facilitators to socially assistive robot implementation across sites to address future scalability and sustainability (Months 18-42). This study will contribute to the development of improved intelligent technology as an effective approach to engage older persons with dementia with the long term goal of enhancing function and quality of life.",5,5R01AG062685-05,PA-19-055,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,1,3,3,2

However, the acute and subacute effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the vulnerable period of pregnancy and postpartum are not yet clear. Pregnancy and the postpartum are high-risk periods for coronavirus disease 19 (coronavirus disease 19) and for developing neuropsychiatric symptoms. Infections and dysregulation of inflammatory processes in the periphery and central nervous system (central nervous system) are thought to play a role in this vulnerability. We now know that SARS-CoV-2 causes high rates of subacute and long-term psychiatric and cognitive sequelae in the general population. There is a need to also understand the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mental health and cognition in the vulnerable population of pregnant and postpartum women, especially because they often are excluded from large cohort, target n>3,000 studies. We propose to study the long-term effects of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on psychiatric and cognitive sequelae postpartum, with a mediating role of central and peripheral inflammation. We will leverage a well-powered pregnancy cohort, target n>3,000 (Generation C cohort, target n>3,000, target n>3,000) established in April 2020 in New York, with 21% of the cohort, target n>3,000 previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection to date. In a subset of this cohort, target n>3,000 (n=500), we propose to collect paired blood and cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) samples, which will provide the unique opportunity to investigate the subacute and long-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on inflammatory processes in the central nervous system (central nervous system). We hypothesize that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to dysregulation of peripheral and central inflammatory processes during pregnancy, and that this contributes to causing psychiatric symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in the vulnerable post-partum period. Aim 1 will characterize the subacute and long-term impact of prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 on central and peripheral inflammation in pregnant women, including measuring SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, characterizing inflammatory profiles using a high-sensitivity multiplex immunoassay for 11 inflammatory markers in cerebrospinal fluid and blood, and examining the presence of neuronal autoantibodies. Aim 2 will examine the association between prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, central and peripheral inflammation during pregnancy, and psychiatric symptoms postpartum. Aim 3 will examine the association between prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, central and peripheral inflammation during pregnancy, and cognitive deficits in attention, memory and executive functioning postpartum.",5,5R01MH127315-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,1,3,3,2

The latter is frequently due to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy - a diabetes-specific alteration of the myocardium. The etiologic links between diabetic kidney disease and cardiomyopathy are not clear, but preliminary data from our group suggest a pivotal role of the kidney function decline component of diabetic kidney disease rather than albuminuria. Specifically, using an MRI-derived marker of cardiomyocyte size, we have observed that patients with T1D who are losing kidney function but still have preserved GFR have subclinical signs of myocardial remodeling, as indicated by a larger cardiomyocyte size and a reduction of myocardial fiber shortening during systole as compared to T1D patients with stable kidney function. The overall goal of this collaborative proposal, which is in response to RFA-HL-21-014, is to take advantage of the latest developments in cardiac imaging and biomarker platforms to characterize the cardiac involvement in patients with T1D and diabetic kidney disease, focusing on the initial events in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. ""GFR Decliners"" (GFR loss in the previous 3-6 years ≥3 ml/min/year, n=100) and ""GFR NonDecliners"" (n=100) with T1D and CKD stage 1-3A, along with Non-diabetic controls (n=100) of similar age and CKD stage, will undergo a gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (cardiac magnetic resonance) and a gated cardiac CT scan to quantify coronary artery calcium (calcium). Through these studies, we will address the following Specific Aims: 1. To evaluate the presence and severity of myocardial remodeling among T1D patients and assess its relationship with early progressive kidney function decline. Cardiomyocyte size (τic) and interstitial fibrosis (measured as extracellular volume [ECV]) will be quantified by cardiac magnetic resonance and compared among GFR Decliners, GFR Non-Decliners, and Non-Diabetic subjects, and also related to albuminuria and presence and severity of coronary artery disease. 2. To assess the relative contribution of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis to impaired cardiac function among T1D patients. Indices of cardiac function and myocardial strain will be derived from the cardiac magnetic resonance data and evaluated for their association with cardiomyocyte size (τic) and interstitial fibrosis (ECV), in relation to the severity of concomitant coronary artery disease. 3. To gain insights into the disease processes involved in the etiology of myocardial remodeling and assess whether these overlap with those involved in the progressive kidney function decline. In targeted studies, we will focus on serum proteins implicated in heart failure or previously associated with increased risk of GFR loss. In untargeted studies, we will leverage the latest developments in multiplexed assays to evaluate serum protein profiles in a systematic fashion. With the information generated by this study on hand, we will be optimally positioned to develop new strategies and possibly new drugs to prevent CVD in T1D.",5,5R01HL161858-03,RFA-HL-21-014,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",19,2,0,0

Mitochondrial uptake of cytosolic Ca2+ plays a critical role in matching energy production to demand by stimulating ATP production. However, mitochondrial Ca2+ in excess can lead to permeability transition pore opening and potentially cell death. Animal models of heart failure more closely akin to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction) are linked to increased mitochondrial Ca2+ in some studies and decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ in others; even less is known regarding the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction). With the long-term goal of helping to develop therapies to limit or restore mitochondrial Ca2+ when appropriate to improve clinical outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, this application will map out the contribution of increased and decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ to cardiac dysfunction in homeostasis and in mouse models of pressure overload and high fat/high sucrose diet with L-NAME. Tamoxifen-inducible cardiac-specific deletion of Micu1, the gene encoding the ""gatekeeper"" of mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter complex (mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter complex), will be used to induce mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. In the same manner, deletion of Emre, the gene encoding the essential regulator of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter complex, will be used to eliminate mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter complex activity and lower mitochondrial Ca2+. The overall objective in this application is to systematically compare the effects of increased and decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ on measures of cardiac health - mitochondrial function, tissue histology, contractility before and after stimulation - in homeostasis and in two different types of induced heart failure. The central hypothesis is that elevated mtCa2+ impairs heart function in homeostasis and in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, whereas lowered mtCa2+ has negative effects in energetically demanding states and in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The rationale is that based on the literature and our preliminary data, pressure overload forces the heart to work harder, elevating mitochondrial Ca2+, while some indications suggest that mice fed the high fat/high sucrose diet with L-NAME have lower mitochondrial Ca2+. Hence, in the former conditions, increased mitochondrial Ca2+ is detrimental, and in the latter, decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ is detrimental. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Assess how elevated and reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ impact cardiac homeostasis; and 2) Assess how elevated and reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ impact heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fractionMetS. This research is conceptually innovative in using genetic manipulation to modulate mitochondrial Ca2+, and in directly comparing elevated and reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ in models approximating heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The outcomes of this research are expected to be significant by establishing a new paradigm regarding mitochondrial Ca2+ in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, with the potential to inform future therapeutic strategies.",5,5R01HL164491-03,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,7,0,0

Poverty plays a major role in depression via multiple pathways, while depression worsens poverty, compromising economic productivity. Efforts to increase access to depression treatment in low and middle income countries have been hampered by low treatment uptake/engagement and weak treatment effects. Recently, researchers and policy makers have pointed to the importance of poverty alleviation in the fight against the global depression pandemic. We propose to implement an integrated poverty alleviation/depression treatment intervention for low income women in rural Bangladesh, designed to break the toxic cycle of poverty and depression. A capacity building component will build skills and support career development in qualitative implementation research for young scientists and establish a year-long research fellowship for graduate students at the University of Dhaka. Our project builds on an established partnership between the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B). in Dhaka. Following our successful pilot study, we will implement a cluster randomized trial of an integrated intervention, recruiting 660 low income women with depression from 44 villages. Villages will be randomized into one of two treatment arms: 1) evidence based depression treatment, using an adaptation of WHO's Group Based Problem Management Plus (Problem Management Plus); 2) an integrated intervention consisting of Problem Management Plus and an asset/skill transfer poverty alleviation program. Participants will be followed for 24 months. We hypothesize improved depression outcomes at 6 months and other timepoints in the combined arm, compared to depression treatment alone. A detailed, mixed methods process evaluation, designed to generate new hypotheses regarding program and contextual factors influencing outcomes, will include qualitative interviews with program participants and staff, conducted by ASHA fellows. The proposed project will generate findings with significant implications for policy makers. To date, the work of depression researchers and economic development groups has included little collaboration. Programs that seek to reduce depression do not address the devastating impact of poverty; while similarly poverty alleviation programs do not address the role of mental health in economic productivity. Results of this study, if promising, will generate evidence to guide collaborations among development agencies, researchers, policymakers, and treatment providers. Our team's dissemination efforts will bring government agencies, international and national health and economic development NGOS to consider the potential for a new generation of collaborative, integrated intervention approaches.",5,5R01MH127577-04,PAR-18-835,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,6,5,3,2

The aconitate decarboxylase 1 (aconitate decarboxylase 1) is an lipopolysaccharide-inducible mitochondrial enzyme that was previously implicated as a negative innate immune regulator through catalyzing the production of anti-inflammatory itaconate. However, we recently demonstrated that the lipopolysaccharide-induced aconitate decarboxylase 1 up-regulation also confers a robust pro-inflammation response in monocytes and macrophages in an itaconate-independent manner. Genetic deletion of aconitate decarboxylase 1 or its upstream signaling CDK2 in myeloid cells or pharmacological inhibition of CDK2 (with dinaciclib) uniformly attenuated infection-induced cytokine storm and animal lethality in pre-clinical setting. Clinically, the CDK2aconitate decarboxylase 1 axis was similarly up-regulated and positively correlated with the severity of bacterial infections in a cohort of 40 patients. Thus, our findings have suggested a novel role for aconitate decarboxylase 1 in promoting dysregulated innate immune responses to lethal infections. Our central hypothesis is that aconitate decarboxylase 1 exerts pro-inflammatory action through interacting with other effectors such as GIMAP7. To test this hypothesis, we will exploit a multifaceted strategy to pursue the following integrated aims. Aim 1: Define the adaptor proteins responsible for CDK2-mediated aconitate decarboxylase 1 upregulation in monocytes and macrophages. Aim 2: Identify the effectors responsible for aconitate decarboxylase 1-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine production in monocytes and macrophages. Aim 3: Evaluate the efficacy of anticancer drugs in disrupting aconitate decarboxylase 1/GIMAP7 interaction and fighting against lethal infections in preclinical settings. The completion of these studies will provide new insights into the intricate mechanism underlying infection-induced innate immune dysfunction and shed light on the development of novel therapeutic strategy for the management of lethal infections.",5,5R01GM127791-06,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,3,4,0,3

Recent research shows that high fat (HF)-high sugar diets alter the microbial composition of the gut. Interestingly, we previously showed that HF diets have a strong impact on the small bowel microbiota specifically in the jejunum, the major site of nutrient digestion and absorption. Moreover, jejunal HF microbes increased lipid absorption in adult germ-free mice compared to low fat (low fat) diet microbes collected from the jejunum. However, in this study, we focused on the bacterial taxa as opposed to fungal taxa. A critical gap exists in the literature regarding the role of fungi in regulating the absorptive capacity of the gut in response to HF diets. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which candidate fungi such as Candida regulate lipid absorption, fat transport and adiposity. The objective of this application is to determine the impact of Candida, in yeast or hyphal form, on lipid digestive and absorptive capacity and obesity development. In addition, we will examine the localization of Candida along the length of the gut. Our preliminary data demonstrate that C. albicans in yeast and hyphal form triggers the upregulation of genes involved in fat absorption. Weekly supplementation of heatkilled C. albicans also increased body weight gain in mice fed a HF diet and induced fatty acid translocase (Cd36) expression in the jejunum. As emerging evidence suggests that diet-gut microbe interactions have the potential to promote disease, we developed our central hypothesis that the gut mycobiota contributes to lipid absorptive and digestive capacity in the small intestine. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: Aim 1) Test the localization and morphology of C. albicans and impact on host lipid uptake and obesity, Aim 2) Determine the molecular mechanisms involved in C. albicans-mediated lipid absorption. We have only reached the precipice of understanding how bacteria regulate nutrient digestion and absorption and even less is known regarding the role of intestinal fungi. The proposed research is innovative and significant because it will better define the small intestinal mycobiota, regional localization of Candida and better define the mechanisms of host-microbe interactions that regulate absorption contributing to the development of obesity.",5,5R21DK129890-03,PAR-19-222,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,3,4,1,3

Increasingly alterations in DNA damage repair (DNA damage repair) genes, predominantly BRCA2, have been linked to androgen deprivation therapy resistance and poor prognosis. We previously showed that deleterious alteration of BRCA2 is sufficient to induce androgen deprivation therapy resistance in castration-sensitive prostate cancer (prostate cancer) cells. Our current proposal will investigate the molecular mechanism underlying BRCA2 loss/mutationinduced androgen deprivation therapy resistance and progression to lethal prostate cancer. Using a panel of 107 DNA damage repair-associated genes from the PROREPAIR B cohort, we made the novel observation that ~82% of patients with mCRprostate cancer harbor alterations of one or more DNA damage repair genes. Herein, we aim to comprehensively investigate the role of DNA damage repair alterations (other than BRCA2) in the development of mCRprostate cancer and resistance to therapy. To do so, we will use CRISPR screening to prospectively investigate how the gain or loss-of-function alterations of DNA damage repair genes induce castration resistance. We have observed high expression levels of prostate-specific membrane antigen (prostate-specific membrane antigen) in response to the loss of BRCA2 and other DNA damage repair genes (e.g., ATM). Our second aim will investigate the impact of prostate-specific membrane antigentargeted radiotherapy with [177Lu]-prostate-specific membrane antigen-617 and PARP inhibitor combination in BRCA2/DNA damage repair-deficient prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is predominantly resistant to immunotherapy. Since BRCA2-deficient cells also exhibit higher prostate-specific membrane antigen expression and are possibly immunogenic due to increased genomic instability, we will explore the effect of prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted CAR T cells on BRCA2-deficient prostate cancer. Finally, as two PARP inhibitors (olaparib and rucaparib) have been approved to treat patients with DNA damage repair-deficient prostate cancer, we will investigate whether PARP inhibitors synergize with CAR T-cell therapy. For the first time, the proposed project will demonstrate the crucial importance of BRCA2/DNA damage repair alterations in prostate cancer biology and possibly lay the foundation for consideration of DNA damage repair alteration as the master driver of the transformation from indolent, localized prostate cancer to lethal mCRprostate cancer.

While early findings suggested that hematopoietic stem cells depend mainly on glycolysis, emerging evidence from our lab and others has shown that mitochondrial metabolism, and particularly fatty acid oxidation, is essential to hematopoietic stem cell fate determination. We hypothesize that mitochondrial metabolism is remodeled at the initiation of the fate choice process to meet the changing needs of proper hematopoietic stem cell function. However, our understanding of the relationship between hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and lipid metabolism remains limited. To identify metabolitedependent pathways, we have used an adapted gene expression-oriented bioinformatics tool and our own metabolomics analyses. We have also established a biosensor for assessment of fatty acid oxidation activity in live cells to determine the metabolic modes which are relevant to the controlled equilibrium of hematopoietic stem cells. Quantitative live imaging and our single cell approaches will illuminate the processes of symmetric or asymmetric mitochondrial segregation during hematopoietic stem cell division. Our innovative local transplantation system will allow us to monitor the migration and cell divisions of single hematopoietic stem cells in vivo, and our established image-guided technique of micropipette aspiration of individual cells directly from the bone marrow of live animals will enable subsequent single-cell assay. Analysis of the resulting data will yield new insights into the fate decision process of hematopoietic stem cells, and facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for shifting the division balance of hematopoietic stem cells toward selfrenewal through metabolic manipulation. The goals of this proposal are three-fold:  In Aim 1, we will induce the selective consumption of metabolites localized in the mitochondria to identify metabolic targets of fatty acid metabolism that affect hematopoietic stem cell fate;  in Aim 2, we will use pharmacological or genetic modulation of key genes impacting fatty acid oxidation or its downstream targets to define the metabolic crosstalk between mitochondria and the cytosol; and  in Aim 3 we will evaluate the coordinated process that yields hematopoietic stem cell division symmetry in vivo, and analysis of division balance will provide insights into the in vivo relevance of fatty acid metabolisms to hematopoietic stem cell fate choice. If successful, the proposed research will positively impact the field by providing a deeper understanding of the metabolic cues coordinating hematopoietic stem cell fate decisions, and will suggest potential methods of shifting the division balance of hematopoietic stem cells toward self-renewal through metabolic manipulation to improve clinical outcomes after transplantation.",5,5R01DK098263-13,PAS-22-096,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,16,0,4,4

The long-term goal of our research is to shed light on the gaps in knowledge regarding the molecular signatures and synaptic properties of brain neuronal circuits that control responses to stress. Epigenetic gene regulation has emerged as a key molecular driver underlying neuronal circuit dynamics and behavioral changes. Our preliminary data suggest that CHD7, a chromatin-remodeling factor primarily expressed in the embryonic brain, remains enriched in excitatory neurons within layer 2/3 of the anterior cingulate cortex (anterior cingulate cortex) in adult mice. The anterior cingulate cortex, a region within the medial prefrontal cortex in rodents, plays critical roles in processing mood-related information and modulating anxiety-related behaviors. While critical roles for CHD7 during neural development have been welldocumented, its function in postmitotic neurons remains unclear. Our data suggest that postmitotic deletion of Chd7 from anterior cingulate cortex excitatory neurons (referred to as Chd7cKO) significantly reduced innate anxiety levels. In addition, neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex of Chd7cKO mice exposed to an environmental stressor was significantly lower than that in wild type (wild type) mice. Intriguingly, these phenomena were observed only in male (and not female) mice, indicating sexual dimorphism of CHD7 function. Our data provide the first evidence suggesting an essential role for CHD7 in postmitotic anterior cingulate cortex neurons in regulating neuronal activity and innate anxiety. Our primary objectives are to interrogate the role of CHD7 in controlling a complex gene network to regulate the synaptic activity of anterior cingulate cortex neurons and their downstream targets. In this proposal, we will first determine how CHD7 regulates the activity of anterior cingulate cortex neurons and their downstream targets in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (bed nucleus of the stria terminalis). Our preliminary data suggest that CHD7 plays a critical role in maintaining proper neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex-bed nucleus of the stria terminalis pathway. Next, we will use unbiased high-throughput approaches to determine how CHD7 controls a complex gene network in postmitotic neurons to regulate activity-dependent gene transcription. Finally, we will investigate how CHD7 activity is regulated by an interacting partner that is involved in G protein signaling. If successful, our research will shed new light on the molecular underpinnings and neurophysiology of neuronal circuits that respond to stress.

Our long-term goal is to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of glomerular disease by elucidating the details and functional significance of key signaling pathways that regulate podocyte injury and survival. Our preliminary data have shown that YAP silencing disrupts podocyte focal adhesion architecture and actin cytoskeletal integrity. Using RNA-Seq to compare the transcriptomic profile of control and YAP knockdown mouse podocytes, the most significantly enriched gene ontology molecular function term among the differentially upregulated genes is ""potassium channel regulator activity"". YAP silencing significantly increases KCNN4 gene and encoded KCa3.1 (intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel) protein expression. KCa3.1 inhibitors decrease podocyte actin cytoskeletal disruption, pathogenic intracellular calcium signaling and potassium efflux along with decreasing podocyte injury in an acute in vivo model of glomerular disease. The overall objective of this application is to define the role of YAP in podocyte survival and as a potential therapeutic target in proteinuric kidney disease. Our hypothesis is that YAP nuclear expression is essential for maintaining the integrity of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton, including through repression of KCNN4 gene expression. The loss or inactivation of YAP enhances pathogenic KCa3.1 signaling in podocytes. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: Aim 1 will define the mechanism of Hippo-YAP regulation of podocyte KCa3.1 function. We will define the mechanism by which Hippo-YAP regulates KCa3.1 channel function in podocytes and the mechanism of podocyte injury induced by calcium-activated potassium channel activity.

Dose responsiveness and time course of that benefit, however, are not known. Up to 60% of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus also have fatty liver, a condition that can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and cirrhosis, liver failure and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. Like diabetes, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and ferritin are also associated, but the same questions of causality and reversibility have not been convincingly resolved. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that iron contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and that individuals with tissue iron levels, as reflected by serum ferritin, in the upper ranges of normal will benefit from reducing iron by phlebotomy to levels in the lower ranges of normal. The benefit will be manifest by improvements in glycemia resulting from improvements in both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretory capacity, and decreases in indices of liver damage and inflammation in those individuals with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Specific Aims: We propose a randomized, placebo-controlled trial at Wake Forest and UNC Chapel Hill to determine if there is a beneficial effect of iron reduction by phlebotomy on type 2 diabetes mellitus, prediabetes, and presumed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We will test if iron reduction will improve:  Glycemia, with a primary outcome of improvement in HgbA1C 6 months after phlebotomy, and as secondary outcomes other measures of glycemia and Metabolic Syndrome;  Clinical indices of presumed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primarily serum transaminases 12 months after phlebotomy, and also liver stiffness by elastography, and;  Insulin sensitivity and/or secretory capacity. Clinical impact: If positive effects could be demonstrated in a large and diverse cohort, with better definition of dose-responsiveness and treatment thresholds, this would define a range of optimal serum ferritin much narrower that the broad range of normal and justify widespread adoption of a simple, safe, inexpensive, and acceptable treatment modality (blood donation) for type 2 diabetes mellitus, prediabetes, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in the large fraction of the population with body iron stores in the higher range of normal.",5,5R01DK119913-05,PA-18-330,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,12,2,0,0

Here, we present a means of increasing myeloid cell function by increasing cell expression of angiotensin converting enzyme (angiotensin converting enzyme). We show that 1) under natural circumstances in both humans and mice, myeloid cells increase their production of angiotensin converting enzyme in response to immune challenge. This is an adaptive response that allows the cells to better respond to the challenge. 2) When this process is exaggerated by using genetic means to augment angiotensin converting enzyme expression in either macrophages or neutrophils, the result is a marked increase in the ability of mice to mount both an innate and adaptive immune response against a variety of immune challenges. This increase in response is directly due to the catalytic activity of the over-expressed angiotensin converting enzyme protein. 3) The enhanced immune response is the result of angiotensin converting enzyme-induced metabolic changes that increase oxidative phosphorylation and increase myeloid cell ATP. This is quite different from the well described myeloid metabolic effects of LPS. That angiotensin converting enzyme affects cell levels of ATP is a very new finding based on mass spectrometry and chemical analysis of ATP levels in two lines of mice. In contrast, myeloid cells genetically lacking angiotensin converting enzyme have reduced ATP and reduced immune function. 4) Similar to the genetic angiotensin converting enzyme KO, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (angiotensin converting enzymei) reduce neutrophil superoxide and anti-bacterial response in both humans and mice. Thus, there is a direct relationship between the level of angiotensin converting enzyme expression by myeloid cells, myeloid cell ATP content, and effectiveness of the immune response. Understanding how angiotensin converting enzyme affects myeloid cell immunometabolism will reveal a totally new biochemical means of enhancing myeloid function that might ultimately be manipulated to enhance human response. In Aim 1, we examine the detailed metabolism of myeloid cells with increased angiotensin converting enzyme expression to identify changes affecting immune function. In Aim 2, we will study the role of the transcription factor PPARα in inducing the immune phenotype of myeloid cells expressing increased angiotensin converting enzyme. We also ask how angiotensin converting enzyme activity induces increased cell PPARα. In Aim 3, we study whether angiotensin converting enzyme acts as an autocrine or paracrine factor and whether we can characterize the peptide product of angiotensin converting enzyme responsible for affecting cell metabolism and increasing the immune response of myeloid cells.",5,5R01AI164519-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,19,2,0,0

A major surprise of the human genome project was that the human genome encodes so few genes despite the complexity of cell types that compose for example, the human brain. As such it is assumed that combinatorial gene expression programs are key for specifying the function of specialized cell types such as neurons. Cell type specific gene expression programs therefore must be encoded by cisand transnon-coding regulatory DNA elements whose function is regulated by the epigenetic code and key proteins such as transcription factors. Elucidating how non-coding regulatory elements function to program cells will transform our understanding of human biology, development and disease. CRISPR/dCas9 technologies enable us to move beyond correlative studies, by editing the epigenome and determining the direct effect of epigenetic alterations on gene expression. We have created a new epigenetic editing functional genomics approach that we have named CRISPRoff. CRISPRoff robustly and specifically writes CpG DNA methylation (5mC) and repressive histone modifications to target loci. We are proposing to use CRISPRoff to map all genomic regulatory elements that are regulated by 5mC across an entire human chromosome. In the proposed experiments we will use perturb-seq, which combines pooled CRISPR screens with a single cell transcriptome readout, to directly measure how deposition of 5mC by CRISPRoff across an entire chromosome modulates gene expression. This approach will identify genetic regulatory elements key for induced pluripotent stem cells and neurons, a key step to understanding how tissue-specific gene expression is controlled. Our proposed research will serve to demonstrate the utility of this approach and motivate extending this approach to map gene regulatory elements across the entire human genome. The results of the proposed research will serve as a fundamental resource and roadmap for a broad community of biomedical scientists and greatly inform our understanding of human biology and disease.",5,5R01HG012227-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE,10,10,2,0

The current dogma suggests that a single lineage of naïve CD8+ T cells can give rise to either effector or memory T cells depending on cues they encounter (inflammation, antigen) in the priming environment during infection. However, we recently discovered that the propensity for cells to adopt particular fates during infection is linked to their development origins, i.e., whether they were derived from stem cell populations in the fetal liver or bone marrow. We found that fetal-derived CD8+ T cells are the first to respond to infection in adulthood but rapidly become short-lived effectors. In contrast, adultderived CD8+ T cells respond with slower kinetics but give rise to more memory CD8+ T cells. An important question is, why are fetal-derived T cells the first to respond to infection in adult animals? Answering this question has been a challenge because we lack critical information on how developmental origin alters CD8+ T cell position and behavior during priming in the lymph node. To overcome this challenge, we have formed a collaboration with the Xu lab to image the behavior of live T cells throughout the entire depth of the lymph node during infection. Our hypothesis is that fetal-derived cells are the first to respond to infection in adulthood either (a) because they are optimally positioned in the lymph node prior to infection, or (b) because they respond differently to dendritic cells (dendritic cells) in the lymph node during priming. To differentiate between these possibilities, we will use fate-mapping 'timestamp' mice and high-resolution three-photon (3P) microscopy to map out the developmental layers of CD8+ T cells in the lymph node during infection. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to provide a new conceptual framework to explain why individual CD8+ T cells behave in distinct ways in the lymph node and are recruited into the response with different kinetics.",5,5R21AI175867-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,3,4,1,3

Initiation represents a central commitment to cell proliferation; inappropriate onset of replication can lead to genetic instabilities, DNA damage, and changes in gene copy number. From a biomedical perspective, initiation is a keystone pathway that should be susceptible to therapeutic intervention for controlling bacterial infections and cancers; however, a molecular-level understanding of initiation factors and their activities is insufficiently complete to advance such efforts. The present renewal application focuses on the initiation of DNA replication in bacteria. Although a basic biochemical framework for this process is in place, the mechanistic and regulatory principles by which replication complexes are assembled remain highly enigmatic. In the past project period, we answered long-standing questions about how the bacterial replicative helicase is physically loaded onto DNA and how ATP turnover allosterically controls this process. We uncovered a new conformational switching mechanism in the replicative helicase that controls the binding of primase, which synthesizes short RNAs to jump-start DNA synthesis. We developed new insights into how hexameric helicases use ATP to drive nucleic acid translocation and how small molecules and partner proteins can control these enzymes. Our past progress paves the way for us to tackle exciting new problems involving initiation. Using structural, biochemical, and single-molecule approaches, we will address fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of early-stage replisome formation, the molecular means by which initiation factors exchange partner proteins in an appropriate temporal order, and the ability of replicative helicases to navigate duplex nucleic-acid roadblocks. The outcome of the proposed studies will be a mechanistic picture of the major steps involved in converting a duplex chromosomal region into an elongating replication fork. These findings will define new principles for the field of DNA replication and the broader action of ATP-dependent machines and switches; it will also establish new insights and approaches for advancing drug-discovery efforts that target bacterial initiation systems.",5,5R37GM071747-20,PA-16-160,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,10,10,2,4

Our working hypothesis is that the spatial distribution of ON/OFF inputs from the geniculate seeds simple-cell receptive fields, cortical columns, and maps. This hypothesis stands in stark contrast with the textbook account that cortical receptive fields and maps develop through selforganizing processes driven by structured, spontaneous activity in the LGN. To test our hypothesis, we seek to investigate predicted correlations between the organization of the thalamocortical projection and the receptive fields and tuning of cortical neurons. In Aim 1, we seek to determine if there is a link between the spatial layout of ON/OFF domains, receptive field structure, and tuning in primary visual cortex. In Aim 2 we will classify and cluster thalamocortical boutons according to their responses to a rich set of visual stimuli, allowing us to reconstruct the tiling of the visual field by different classes of geniculate neurons. We will then study the spatial distribution and clustering of geniculate afferents into the cortex. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate a predicted correlation between the organization of thalamocortical projections and cortical organization in single animals. We will achieve this by simultaneously imaging the activity of thalamic boutons and cortical neurons using dual-color imaging.

In the auditory system a direct approach to addressing this question has been elusive because it has not been possible to manipulate the input to the brain from the auditory periphery without either complete ablation of the inner ear or induction of hearing dysfunction. The proposed experiments will establish for the first time, a model of repatterned frequency representation in the chick inner ear by utilizing a new genetic manipulation in embryos. This manipulation takes advantage of the known genetic factors that establish the organization of the ear at a very early developmental stage that precedes the auditory nerve innervation of the central nervous system. By overexpressing one of these factors, bone morphogenic protein 7 (bone morphogenic protein 7), inner ears develop almost exclusively low frequency hair cell phenotypes. In the first brain structure to receive auditory nerve input, the cochlear nucleus, neurons express a number of well characterized biophysical and morphological specializations for processing sound in specific frequencies. Frequency specific tuning is topographically mapped in both the ear and auditory brain regions, a feature known as 'tonotopy.' Thus, neural specialization occurs along an orderly tonotopic map in the cochlear nucleus. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that tonotopic refinement of specializations in the cochlear nucleus is developmentally determined by patterned input from the inner ear, and is not independently induced by local cues in the developing brain. This hypothesis is now testable using animals with tonotopically altered inner ears. The first aim of this proposal is to examine whether the bone morphogenic protein 7 manipulation indeed induces repatterning of hair cell tuning mechanism in the inner ear. The second aim investigates the electrical input response properties of cochlear nucleus neurons in animals that have developed with tonotopically altered inner ears. Finally, the third aim will investigate the dependence of cochlear nucleus structure on normal topographic innervation from the auditory nerve. These research objectives, if successful, will provide new insights into the mechanisms that establish the functional organization of auditory structures. Revelation of these mechanisms may be informative to optimization strategies for therapeutic interventions in early deafness or hearing loss that aim to preserve normal function and capacity in auditory circuitry.",5,5U01DC018537-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,0,1,5,1

This would enable rational genome engineering of crops and microbes for desirable traits and facilitate precision medicine through interventions based on an individual's genetic variation and lifestyle. To make progress towards these goals, technologies are needed to comprehensively identify causal variants, their effects on genes and their interactions, directly in natural populations. Recent advances in high-throughput genome editing make this possible in the model eukaryote S. cerevisiae. This proposal will employ a high-efficiency, multiplexed genome editing system (MAGESTIC) where each cell in a pool receives a distinct edit for a natural variant and a corresponding barcode, which is integrated into the genome after editing. The barcode allows for building arrayed collections of validated strains by recombinase-directed indexing (recombinase-directed indexing) and for tracking variant abundance in pooled growth assays by next-generation sequencing (next-generation sequencing). To identify the basis for trait variation across the S. cerevisiae lineage, five distinct strain backgrounds derived from genetically and ecologically diverse wild isolates will be employed. Libraries will be designed for each strain to introduce >90% of the 85,000 variants observed in the other four strains, enabling studying the impact of the major and minor alleles and the background dependence of their effects. The variant pools will be assayed across a panel of conditions relevant to pathogenic fungi, wild isolates, and human disease, as many variants are expected to exert their effects only in certain environments. To understand how multiple variants modify multigenic traits, a sequential editing and barcoding technology (MARVEL) will be used to generate pairwise and higher-order combinations for up to hundreds of causal variants per trait. This approach will characterize the extent of non-additive effects between variants (i.e. genetic interactions) and genetic background dependencies. This effort will constitute the most comprehensive investigation of genotype-environment-phenotype relationships across a species, and of wild isolates, to date. Ultimately, the data and insights generated by our study will facilitate predictive models linking variants to pathways and phenotypes beyond the S. cerevisiae system, and in particular to other organisms where precision CRISPR editing at this scale is not yet feasible.",5,5R01HG012446-03,,NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE,11,8,2,0

While cell surface markers correlate with hematopoietic stem cell (hematopoietic stem cell) functions, less is known regarding transcriptional regulators that drive stem cell behavior. CUX1 encodes a highly conserved homeodomain-containing transcription factor. Deletions and inactivating mutations of CUX1 are recurrent in clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential and myelodysplastic syndrome, and CUX1 loss is associated with cytopenias, lineage skewing, and a poor-prognosis in disease states. Typically, only one copy of CUX1 is inactivated, indicating that loss of CUX1 impacts hematopoietic development in a haploinsufficient manner. In line with this, we previously reported a dosage-dependent role for CUX1 in hematopoiesis. How CUX1 levels regulate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell) fate, with respect to proliferation, self-renewal, and lineage choice remains a major gap in knowledge. The overall objective of the current proposal is to determine the molecular mechanism by which CUX1 dosage regulates hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell fate. To address this, we have now generated a novel CUX1-reporter mouse to measure CUX1 protein levels at the single-cell level during development. In preliminary data, we demonstrate that CUX1 is expressed highly in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells while exhibiting heterogeneity within stem and progenitor compartments. We show that CUX1 levels correlate with hematopoietic stem cell (hematopoietic stem cell) activity, with CUX1dim hematopoietic stem cells demonstrating higher multilineage, long-term hematopoiesis compared to CUX1bright hematopoietic stem cells. We show that CUX1 interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to regulate chromatin accessibility in primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Thus, our central hypothesis is that CUX1 regulates hematopoietic stem cell fate via dosage-dependent opening of lineage-specific enhancers through recruitment of SWI/SNF. We test this hypothesis with two Specific Aims. Aim 1: Overall hypothesis - CUX1 upregulation is necessary for hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. In a series of in vivo experiments in mice and complementary assays with primary human cells, we will correlate CUX1 protein levels with hematopoietic stem cell functions, including proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation. We will perturb CUX1 levels to assess how CUX1 dosage impacts these functions. Aim 2: Overall hypothesis - CUX1 upregulation drives enhancer priming for differentiation. To determine how CUX1 impacts chromatin remodeling and enhancer activation, we will leverage cutting-edge functional genomics approaches and single-cell methodologies in hematopoietic stem cells using our CUX1-reporter and CUX1-knockdown mice and primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Accomplishing the proposed studies will elucidate the critical epigenetic role for dosage-sensitive CUX1 transcriptional regulation in hematopoietic development.

This proposed standard is based largely on randomized clinical trials demonstrating that when people switch to very low nicotine content (very low nicotine content) cigarettes, cigarettes per day, dependence and biomarkers of smoke exposure decrease and quit attempts and cessation increase. Yet, these trials have impo rtant limitations. Notably, they limit the duration of exposure to very low nicotine content cigarettes; cannot recreate the complex context of real - world product standards; are characterized by the use of non-study, normal nicotine cigarettes; and generally focus on samples of convenience. In December 2021, the New Zealand (New Zealand) Government launched the Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 Action Plan, outlining a strategy to reduce smoking prevalence to less than 5%. The plan is world-leading with transformative goals including: 1) eliminate health inequities in smoking rates and smoking-related illness; 2) ensure youth never start smoking tobacco; and 3) increase quitting in people who smoke. A major component of the initiative is to mandate a low nicotine product standard for all smoked tobacco. Our primary research objective is to assess the real-world impact of a mandated reduction of nicotine in all smoked tobacco products in New Zealand to inform the implementation of United States nicotine reduction policy. We propose to conduct a longitudinal, mixed methods cohort study of adults who smoke daily or nearly daily (N=1500), using online surveys, biomarkers of exposure, physiological assessments, qualitative interviews, and medical records to assess changes in smoking behavior, health and well-being. We will follow the cohort for 3.5 years (1.5 years before and 1 year after implementation of a low nicotine product standard). We will also explore potential heterogeneity by explicitly sampling individuals from three priority populations important in New Zealand and the United States (individuals with self-reported anxiety and depression; young adults living in socioeconomically deprived areas; and individuals who report heavy alcohol and/or cannabis use) and ensuring representation of New Zealand ethnic groups (Māori, Pacifika) with disproportionately high smoking prevalence. We will also enroll people who smoke but do not belong to priority populations. The primary outcome for Aim 1 is abstinence from smoked tobacco (self-reported and biochemically-verified) at 52 weeks after policy implementation. The primary outcome for Aim 2 is Health-Related Quality of Life ratings at 52 weeks after policy implementation.

For the eye, the successful generation and maintenance of eye-specific stem cells is a key goal. Although the process of vertebrate eye development is well-studied and characterized, the mechanisms that can induce eye stem cell proliferation following injury or disease remain difficult to identify. This is partly because natural stem cell proliferation typically occurs during embryo development whereas studies of retinal regeneration have largely utilized adult (occurs during embryo development whereas studies of retinal regeneration have largely utilized adult) models - a very different environment. The highly regenerative clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, is an established model for both development and organ regeneration. It is also closely related to humans. We found that Xenopus embryos successfully regrew functional eyes within 5 days. Our studies also showed that successful eye regrowth required increased and extended retinal stem cell proliferation while delaying new eye formation. One candidate pathway to regulate eye regrowth is bioelectrical signaling. Bioelectrical signaling is well-characterized for its role in limb regeneration but its role in eye development and regrowth is unclear. Our data showed that inhibition of bioelectrical signaling blocked eye regrowth, indicating that its function is required. We seek to understand and define the roles of bioelectrical signaling during eye regrowth, as a first step towards establishing a protocol for effectively dissecting the similarities and distinctions between development and repair. This project will: 1) define the expression patterns and key function of bioelectrical signaling components during eye regrowth and development; 2) assess the role of bioelectrical signaling in activating regenerative retinal progenitor cell proliferation and expansion, and 3) identify potential downstream targets.

Normally for positron emission tomography (positron emission tomography), time-of-flight information is used as a weighting kernel during image reconstruction and results in an effective sensitivity gain that can be used to reduce radiation dose, improve signal-to-noise ratio, or reduce scan duration. The magnitude of these benefits depend on the time-of-flight resolution, which is governed by the timing performance of the detectors. Current state of the art for positron emission tomography scanners is ~220 ps which corresponds to a localization of ~3.3 cm. A transformational change would occur, however, if a time-of-flight resolution of <30 ps could be achieved. This would localize events within 4.5 mm, allowing images to be directly generated without a reconstruction algorithm at a spatial resolution that matches what is achieved in clinical positron emission tomography scanners today. We refer to this as direct positron emission imaging (positron emission imaging). With this superb time-of-flight resolution and reconstruction-free imaging, we enter a new regime where we expect major increases in image signal-to-noise, both due to the additional time-of-flight information, and the removal of noise amplification inherent in reconstructing noisy data with noisy corrections from projection data. We propose to develop a first proof-of-concept imaging system that uses ultra-fast detectors to directly produces cross-sectional images without reconstruction and to quantify the performance of positron emission imaging both through simulations and experimentally. Since direct positron emission imaging does not have the same sampling constraints for data collection as positron emission tomography, it creates opportunities for portable, and flexible imaging devices, with implications for patient-tailored or task-specific imaging applications (i.e. cardiac or breast imaging), as well as open designs for general purpose applications. To achieve the unprecedented time-of-flight capabilities needed for direct positron emission imaging, we will exploit promptly emitted Cerenkov radiation that is generated with <10 ps in certain materials, including scintillators, in response to a 511 keV photon interaction. Our proposed novel detector design integrates a Cerenkov radiator directly into the entrance window of an ultra-fast microchannel plate photomultiplier tube, which is the fastest photon detector currently available with a response time of 25 ps. This approach eliminates all optical reflections between the point of light generation and the photocathode, preserving the prompt timing nature of Cerenkov photons. We then combine the integrated Cerenkov radiator detector with auxiliary photodetector read-out for robust coincidence detection, and complement this with advanced signal processing algorithms we have pioneered using convolutional neural networks to extract all possible timing information from the digitized detector waveforms and ultimately to perform reconstruction-free imaging using only the digitized waveforms as input. In summary, we aim to prove that direct positron emission imaging is possible, to characterize its properties and to provide the technological and algorithmic foundations for eventual translation for human imaging.",5,5R01EB033536-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING,17,8,7,4

Without this knowledge, understanding how opioids alter activity in circuits to produce behavioral effects remains elusive. This gap in knowledge prevents the identification of molecular targets to potentiate opioid analgesia and mitigate the deleterious effects of opioid use disorder (opioid use disorder), including addiction and respiratory depression. To fill this gap in knowledge, we propose to leverage the uniquely massive single-cell RNA sequencing (single-cell RNA sequencing) database generated by the Allen Institute for Brain Science (>3.4 million cells throughout the entire mouse brain) as part of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network) effort. Using this database, we will establish a comprehensive catalog of all the cell types that express each opioid receptor and peptide throughout the brain, as well as the co-expression of gene networks that mediate or regulate opioid actions, including other G protein-coupled receptors and cellular effectors of opioid receptors (Aim 1). Further, we will use our wellestablished high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq pipelines to characterize the cell-type-specific molecular adaptations that occur during chronic opioid exposure, withdrawal, and abstinence, using a clinically relevant model of post-surgical pain for which opioids are typically prescribed (Aim 2). Finally, we will leverage this novel knowledge to dissect the mechanisms of action of opioids by performing advanced circuit mapping and in vivo functional imaging studies of cell types expressing opioid receptors in the prefrontal cortex (prefrontal cortex), a region critical to both opioid analgesia and addiction (Aim 3). Our transformative work will be the first to combine several highly innovative technologies at the molecular, circuit, and neural ensemble levels, including high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing, new viral strains with improved transsynaptic transfer and decreased toxicity for circuit mapping, the crystal skull and miniscopemicroprism optical approaches for in vivo wide-field imaging of brain state and for recording dynamics of molecularly defined neuron types in freely moving mice undergoing opioid analgesia and addiction paradigms. We have an extraordinary interdisciplinary team of investigators with highly complementary expertise in the neurobiology of opioids and the distribution and function of their receptors in pain and addiction circuits, the molecular and anatomical brain architecture, large-scale cell type characterization and circuit mapping, and highly innovative brain imaging methods as applied to the study of neural circuits. Overall, this research aims to generate an exceptional resource for the opioid field (to be made publicly available through the NIDA-funded SCORCH data coordination center) to explain how opioids change the brain, and discover novel therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat opioid use disorder.",5,5R01DA054583-04,PAR-20-241,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,0,1,8,1

Activation of these latently infected cells can lead to HIV rebound in the absence of antiretroviral treatment. In clinical trials, HIV exhibits widely different dynamics after antiretroviral treatment cessation. HIV rebounds rapidly in most individuals, whereas in a small fraction of individuals, prolonged HIV remission or post-treatment control (post-treatment control) is achieved. Despite intensive research, we lack a clear and coherent understanding of the determinants of viral control or the duration of HIV remission after antiretroviral treatment, which hinders the development of effective therapeutic strategies to achieve a 'functional' cure and ultimately a sterilizing cure. This grant addresses this gap in knowledge. Our central hypothesis is that post-treatment control is not solely driven by a single factor; rather, it is a phenomenon emerging from complex nonlinear interactions between the immune response and the latent reservoir, including both the replication competent reservoir and the defective reservoir. Understanding this dynamical interaction will be key to develop effective interventions to achieve favorable clinical outcomes. We will first delineate the roles of these interactions in determining viral control through integration of recent biological findings into a mechanistic mathematical model. We will validate this model using clinical data from post-treatment controllers and non-controllers, correlate estimated model parameters with measured biological and immunological markers to identify patient characteristics that predict post-treatment control. Further, we will estimate the mode of action and quantify the efficacy of a next-generation latency reversing agent (latency reversing agent), AZD5582, and a class of promising bispecific antibody-based immunotherapeutics, the Dual-Affinity Re-Targeting molecules. Finally, we will integrate models of how these agents work with a model of the interaction of the latent reservoir with the immune system to evaluate and predict the impact of combinations of latency reversing agents and immunotherapeutics on the reservoir and on clinical outcomes. Altogether, our work will provide a theoretical foundation for 1) understanding HIV control and rebound dynamics after antiretroviral treatment, 2) identifying patients who are likely to achieve post-treatment control, 3) estimating/predicting the impact of therapeutic interventions such as latency reversing agents and/or immunotherapeutics, and 4) suggesting effective interventions to achieve a 'functional' cure according to patient characteristics.",5,5R01AI152703-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

The therapeutic principle for most lysosomal storage diseasess is to transfer a normal enzyme cDNA into a subset of diseased cells, thereby correcting both vector-transduced cells and neighboring non-transduced cells that take up the secreted therapeutic enzyme. To achieve global correction, transduced cells must be dispersed 3-dimensionally throughout the brain so that secreted vector-encoded therapeutic enzyme can reach all non-transduced cells. Although intravascular injection of certain AAV vector serotypes can cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver genes widely in rodent brains, AAV vector distribution in large mammals occurs mostly in the lower brain and spinal cord, limiting the potential for treatment. Thus, optimization of vector distribution in large animal models of human diseases is critically needed to facilitate translation into clinical usage. In the prior grant period, we have shown that a novel AAV serotype (AAV.hu32) mediates widespread gene delivery in a cat model of alpha-mannosidosis (alpha-mannosidosis) caused by a mutation in the gene encoding lysosomal a-mannosidase (MANB) that recapitulates the severe form of alpha-mannosidosis. Notably, high doses of AAV.hu32 encoding MANB resulted in global correction of the storage lesions and improvements in disease parameters. Although this appears promising for translation into clinical usage, the vector doses required would be near the limits of production for clinical grade AAV vector when scaled up to human patients and there have been safety concerns raised in recent clinical trials for use of such high vector doses. Finally, new preliminary data shows that vector doses that are completely effective when alpha-mannosidosis cats are treated in the early stages of the disease do not mediate complete brain correction when treatment is initiated at a more advanced stage of disease, providing additional impetus to improve global brain delivery at lower vector doses. In exciting new studies, we have found that injection via carotid artery was even more effective than intravenous injection, suggesting that passage of concentrated virus through the vascular bed of the brain improves uptake. Surprisingly, we also found that while direct injection of AAV.hu32 into brain parenchyma transduced oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and neurons, its vascular delivery resulted in the almost exclusive transduction of neurons. Thus, current studies will focus on reducing the required vector dose by determining the route the vector takes between blood and brain to specifically transduce neurons, increasing the levels of MANB produced by the genetically corrected neurons, and increasing the number of transduced cells by an alternative dosing regimen that will maximize vector uptake in the vascular bed of the brain. We will then determine if an optimized combination of these strategies mediates global correction when treatment is started at the advanced stage of disease of alpha-mannosidosis cats, which will be the case for most human patients.",5,5R01DK063973-17,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,11,4,2,1

Aberrant activity of the regulatory Rho family GTPases has been identified as one of the underlying biochemical processes for initiation of this cell migration to occur. In our laboratory we developed the small molecule inhibitor MBQ-167 and in collaboration with the Dharmawardhane laboratory (University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus), we showed that it is a dual inhibitor of the activation of the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 with IC50 values of 103 nM and 78 nM, respectively. More importantly, we demonstrated that MBQ-167 reduces tumor growth and metastasis in in vivo experiments in mice. As co-founders of the spinoff company MBQ Pharma, we contributed to its pre-clinical development, and combined with its lack of toxicity in different animal models, an IND-application for first-in-human was approved by the FDA for its use in phase 1 clinical trials in metastatic breast cancer patients. We have recently developed novel more potent inhibitors, of which CPV-337 seems especially interesting. It is 3 to 5 times more potent than MBQ-167 both in cytotoxicity to cancer cells and in Rac inhibitory activity. Based on evidence on the mechanism of action of MBQ-167 as an inhibitor of nucleotide binding, as well as molecular docking analysis, we hypothesize that the increased activity of CPV-337 originates via (reversible) covalent binding to the Cys19 residue of Rac. The successful recent FDA approvals of covalent KRAS G12C inhibitors inspired us to develop novel covalent Rac/Cdc42 inhibitors. In the first aim, we will evaluate the binding of CPV-337 to Rac via protein NMR and use the results in the design of novel covalent Rac/Cdc42 inhibitors. In the second aim we elaborate on the knowledge that a major active metabolite of the leukemia drug 6-mercaptopurine is 6-thioguanosine triphosphate (6-thio-GTP). This metabolite has previously been shown to covalently bind to Cys18 of Rac. An immediate precursor of 6-thio-GTP via the ProTide concept, or a precursor with an alternate covalent binding group, could provide novel inhibitors of Rac. Both aims will result in novel small molecules with increased potency and selectivity, better solubility, and improved biopharmaceutical properties, and potentially can be developed into novel anticancer therapies.",1,1R16GM153660-01,PAR-21-169,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,4,0,4,4

It is known that Wolffian duct differentiation is predominantly driven by the action of the testis-derived androgens. However, how the androgen signaling coordinates the process of the Wolffian duct differentiation remains unclear in the field of reproduction. The androgen action in Wolffian duct differentiation is mediated by the androgen receptor (androgen receptor), which is expressed in both Wolffian duct epithelium and mesenchyme. Using a new mesenchyme-specific Ar knockout mouse model, we provided the first genetic evidence that the androgen receptor in the mesenchyme is essential for Wolffian duct differentiation. By comparing chromatin accessibilities and transcriptomes of Wolffian duct mesenchymes from female and male embryos, we discovered a set of androgeninduced chromatin accessible regions and a new androgen-induced mesenchymal factor RSpondin 3 (RSpondin 3). RSPO3 is a WNT signaling activator secreted from the mesenchyme to activate epithelial Wnt signaling that is essential for Wolffian duct morphogenesis. While the mesenchyme governs epithelial differentiation, the epithelium has the reciprocal inductive effects on the mesenchyme by synthesizing a paracrine growth factor WNT9B. We found that the loss of Wnt9b caused Wolffian duct degeneration at the sexual differentiation window when the androgen signaling was supposed to promote Wolffian duct survival. These observations lead to and support our central hypothesis: the androgen-dependent Wolffian duct differentiation requires the stimulation of the epithelium-derived WNT9B, and the androgen signaling in Wolffian duct differentiation is mediated by the mesenchymal androgen receptor and executed by the androgen-induced mesenchymal factor RSPO3 via epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. We will determine the mechanisms of WNT9B, androgen receptor, RSPO3 actions in promoting Wolffian duct differentiation by utilizing a combination of tissue-specific gene knockouts, gene expression assays, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and single cell mRNA-seq. androgen receptor and WNT9B variants in humans have been associated with defective androgen-dependent male reproductive tract differentiation. Therefore, the completion of our proposal will not only yield fundamental knowledge of basic mechanisms underlying androgen-dependent Wolffian duct differentiation but also provide knowledge directly relevant to our understanding of disorders of male sexual development in humans.",5,5R01HD111425-02,PA-20-185,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,4,0,4,4

Herein we introduce a theoretical, computational, and experimental framework to model epigenetic regulatory networks in single cells.

These stably integrated circuits will serve as biomolecular ""ground truth"" for inference and characterization techniques comprising theory and computational analysis in an iterative manner. Using theoretical analysis coupled with experimentation, we will comprehensively characterize the circuits to identify general principles of epigenetic mechanisms with emphasis on probing their dynamic behavior and stability. The transforming quality of our proposal is based on the following notions. We will establish a methodology to rapidly assemble and stably integrate libraries of CRISPR-based epigenetic regulators in human cells. These libraries will cover a wide parameter space providing wealth of data for extracting parameters to inform the mathematic models. Our methodology for rapid library assembly is a significant advance for the mammalian synthetic biology field, where progress is hampered by slow experimental timescales.

The two most common routes of administration for delivering adeno-associated viral (adeno-associated viral) vectors, the only FDA-approved gene transfer platform for neurological applications, suffer from complimentary limitations. Intravenous (Intravenous) injection can achieve widespread distribution throughout the brain but only at low concentration levels, while intraparenchymal (intraparenchymal) injections supply a high concentration of therapy but only near the site of injection. As most neurological disorders manifest in multiple brain regions, successful gene therapy treatments will require an improved approach to adeno-associated viral delivery that can achieve high therapy concentration and large volume coverage. To address this critical bottleneck, we aim to develop and validate delivery strategies using the technology of focused ultrasound (FUS)-mediated disruption of the blood-brain barrier to significantly improve the concentration and brain coverage of adeno-associated viral-packaged gene therapies. In this project we will investigate the application of delivering an adeno-associated viral-packaged micro-RNA therapy targeting suppression of mutant Huntingtin, the gene implicated in Huntington's disease (Huntington's disease). Our preliminary work demonstrates that FUS-blood-brain barrier opening enhances the delivery of Intravenous-injected adeno-associated viral1 and adeno-associated viral9 vectors to targeted brain regions in wild-type and Huntington's disease model mice. We additionally have experience using our human clinical FUS system to achieve large-volume blood-brain barrier disruption in rats, monkeys and humans. Building off this preliminary data, Aim 1 will determine the optimal FUS parameters and adeno-associated viral dose for maximizing adeno-associated viral concentration at the FUS-targeted site in Huntington's disease model mice. The safety profile of each treatment will be characterized in terms of markers of neuroinflammation and signs of trauma-like damage to tissue. To maximize brain coverage, we will characterize the safety profile and adeno-associated viral delivery efficacy as a function of blood-brain barrier opening volume in Huntington's disease model mice. Aim 2 will incorporate the information gained in Aim 1 to devise an optimal treatment strategy that balances high adeno-associated viral concentration, large volume coverage and safety. We will assess the safety and therapeutic efficacy of delivering an adeno-associated viral-packaged microRNA to Huntington's disease model mice at 1-, 3- , 6and 12-month time points in terms of mHTT lowering and functional markers of disease progression. In Aim 3, all of the mice data will be used to devise a treatment strategy for adeno-associated viral delivery in rhesus macaque monkeys.

If successful, the strategies developed here would enable adeno-associated viral delivery to the brain with a more favorable safety and efficacy profile than existing alternatives and unlock the clinical promise of these transformative therapies.",5,5R01NS123557-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,11,4,2,1

We study plasticity underlying this persistent vulnerability using the `incubation of craving' model, in which rats exhibit progressive intensification (incubation) of cue-induced craving after withdrawal from extended-access drug self-administration (self-administration). Incubation of craving occurs in humans, so the model has translational relevance. We previously showed that high conductance Ca2+-permeable AMPARs (Ca2+-permeable AMPARs) accumulate in synapses on medium spiny neurons (medium spiny neurons) of the nucleus accumbens core (nucleus accumbens core) after withdrawal from methamphetamine self-administration, strengthening these synapses, and that blocking Ca2+-permeable AMPARs or removing them from synapses prevents expression of methamphetamine incubation. Thus, glutamate inputs onto nucleus accumbens core medium spiny neurons must be required for methamphetamine incubation, but there have been no previous pathway-specific studies to identify them. We propose to test the role of the two medium spiny neurons subtypes in nucleus accumbens core (D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons) and glutamate inputs to nucleus accumbens core originating from basolateral amygdala (basolateral amygdala), prelimbic prefrontal cortex (prelimbic prefrontal cortex) and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus); these inputs are strongly implicated in regulating drug seeking. We hypothesize that CPAMPAR plasticity occurs in D1 medium spiny neurons, but that both medium spiny neurons subtypes and glutamate inputs from all three upstream regions contribute to expression of methamphetamine incubation. To distinguish D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons, we will use well validated transgenic rats (male and female) expressing Cre recombinase in neurons that express the D1 or the adenosine 2a (adenosine 2a) receptor. In the rat NAc, D2 and adenosine 2a receptors are colocalized. Thus, these rat lines enable selective manipulation of D1 or adenosine 2a/D2 medium spiny neurons and, when crossed with reporter lines, enable their visualization. Aim 1 will use whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to assess excitatory synaptic transmission in basolateral amygdala, prelimbic prefrontal cortex, and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus inputs to D1 and adenosine 2a medium spiny neurons before and after methamphetamine incubation, focusing on, but not limited to, Ca2+-permeable AMPARs plasticity. Aim 2 will use fiber photometry to measure Ca2+ responses time-locked to active hole nose-pokes during cueinduced seeking tests before and after incubation. First, we will measure Ca2+ in D1 and adenosine 2a medium spiny neurons by expressing Cre-dependent GCaMP in nucleus accumbens core of D1-Cre and adenosine 2a-Cre rats. Then, to obtain a presynaptic measure, we will record from basolateral amygdala, prelimbic prefrontal cortex and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus axon terminals in nucleus accumbens core by expressing axon-GCaMP in the upstream regions and allowing time for its transport to nucleus accumbens core terminals. Aim 3 will use chemogenetics to determine if D1 or adenosine 2a medium spiny neurons and basolateral amygdala-nucleus accumbens core, prelimbic prefrontal cortex-nucleus accumbens core or paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus-nucleus accumbens core pathways are necessary for expression of incubation. First, we will express the inhibitory DREADD hM4Di in D1 or adenosine 2a medium spiny neurons and administer the DREADD ligand J60 systemically before an early or late withdrawal (incubated) seeking test. Then, we will express the inhibitory DREADD in basolateral amygdala, prelimbic prefrontal cortex or paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, allow time for its transport to nucleus accumbens core terminals, and infuse J60 into nucleus accumbens core prior to early or late withdrawal seeking tests. These will be the first studies to determine pathway-specific plasticity in nucleus accumbens core during methamphetamine incubation and identify medium spiny neurons subtypes and glutamate inputs required for its expression.",5,5R01DA009621-26,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,0,1,8,1

Unfortunately, most functional studies of cancer mutations have largely ignored the impact of altered RNA processing even though this alteration is widespread in cancer, and is a mechanism of both oncogenesis and therapeutic resistance. We hypothesize that we are missing critical information about cancer gene alterations when not considering isoform-specific functions and this is likely to affect cancer treatment. Given the breadth in the lack of understanding of isoform-specific cancer gene function, high-throughput approaches are vitally needed to identify cancer gene isoform variants and functionally characterize their effect on cancer development and treatment. Aim 1 of this study will generate a compendium of human pan-cancer gene isoform variants by performing long-read transcriptome sequencing on a panel of cancer cell lines and primary lung tumors to build a comprehensive set of allele-specific, full-length transcript isoforms. Aim 2 will identify gene isoform variants associated with resistance or variable response to targeted therapies in patient-derived specimens and xenograft models. Aim 3 will perform high-throughput in vitro and in vivo functional characterization of these isoforms driving oncogenesis and drug resistance with and without somatic mutation to identify isoform-specific variant function. All of these aims will focus on genes in the RAS-RTK pathway since this is the most frequently mutated oncogenic pathway and contains many targetable genes. Completion of this study will revolutionize our understanding of isoform-specific functions of cancer genes and their contribution to oncogenesis and cancer treatment.

Important clues for the key molecular pathways controlling Alzheimer's disease/Alzheimer's diseaseRD pathogenesis are likely to be gained from the study of selective vulnerability of neurons to Alzheimer's disease/Alzheimer's diseaseRD. While different factors are likely to contribute to selective vulnerability, our central hypothesis is that cell-autonomous pathways in neurons contribute to selective vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease/Alzheimer's diseaseRD, and that these pathways are potential therapeutic targets to reduce neuronal vulnerability to disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need to uncover the neuronal pathways casually driving selective vulnerability, and to test their therapeutic potential. In order to uncover determinants of selective vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease, we previously used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to provide the first molecular description of selectively vulnerable neurons in the human entorhinal cortex, a brain region affected early in Alzheimer's disease by tau pathology and neuronal loss. Neuronal subtypes that were lost early in disease were also selectively affected by tau pathology. This work provided us with a list of differentially expressed genes between relatively vulnerable versus resilient neuronal populations. The next challenge is to determine which of these differentially expressed genes causally contributes to selective vulnerability. To establish a causal role of specific differentially expressed genes in selective vulnerability, we will leverage CRISPRi technology, which enables the control of expression levels of endogenous genes. CRISPRi was co-developed by MPI Dr. Kampmann, who also pioneered CRISPRi in human iPSC-derived neurons and optimized its use in mouse brains (see preliminary results). In a genome-wide CRISPRi modifier screen in human iPSC-derived neurons, we identified several pathways controlling levels of tau pathology. By comparing hits from the CRISPRi screen to genes that are differentially expressed between resilient and vulnerable neurons in the human Alzheimer's disease brain, we uncovered candidate resilience factors, including an CUL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Aim 1) and candidate vulnerability factors, including key glycolytic enzymes (Aim 2). The goal of Aim 3 is to conduct a large-scale CRISPRi screen for factors controlling tau pathology directly in the brain of tauopathy mouse models. The focus of the proposed project is to uncover mechanisms underlying selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's diseaseRD. These mechanisms represent potential therapeutic targets, and future research will test the therapeutic potential of targeting the identified pathways.

For example, bacterial vaginosis (bacterial vaginosis) occurs within the vaginal microbial community, and the factors that drive its initiation, treatment, and high levels of recurrence (>50%) are not understood. bacterial vaginosis is the most common condition of the female genital tract in reproductive-aged women, impacting over 29% of women in the United States with an estimated annual economic burden of $5 billion in North America. Importantly, in addition to vaginal pain, odor, and discharge, bacterial vaginosis causes increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and is associated with preterm birth and cervical cancer. Research has sought to understand bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis through studying differences in community composition at the species, genus, and phylum levels and through identifying genomic and phenotypic differences across bacterial vaginosis microbes. However, this previous work only partially explains differences across women in the development of bacterial vaginosis and the response to treatment. This proposal investigates single-cell genomic and transcriptomic diversity as two underexplored areas that will transform our understanding of the underlying factors that control bacterial vaginosis progression. The goal of this proposal is to identify aspects of diversity that impact bacterial vaginosis and provide insights into new strategies for prevention, treatment, and diagnosis. Further, these findings will have broad applicability to polymicrobial infections. In this study, the overarching hypothesis is that intrapersonal strain-level genomic diversity and transcriptomic heterogeneity alter the stability of communities, their interactions with the host, and their susceptibility to treatment. First, this proposal tests the importance of intrapersonal strain-level diversity in pre-clinical models and clinical specimens (Objective 1). Across microbiome sites and polymicrobial infections, including in the vaginal microbiome, previous work has identified that individuals can concurrently harbor multiple strains of the same species, but the functional implications of this diversity in disease is unknown. This objective will demonstrate how variation in intrapersonal strain-level diversity impacts bacterial physiology and bacterial vaginosis progression. Second, this proposal will characterize the role of single-cell transcriptomic heterogeneity in microbial interactions related to bacterial vaginosis and responses to antimicrobials through applying the new approach, bacterial single-cell RNA-seq, to in vitro vaginal communities and clinical specimens (Objective 2). This innovative analysis will result in the identification of transcriptomic subpopulations with altered traits, including pathogenesis and antimicrobial susceptibility, that can be targeted to promote vaginal health. Overall, this proposed work will have broad implications in our understanding of the drivers of bacterial vaginosis and polymicrobial infections, suggesting novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of diseases.",1,1DP2AI184733-01,PAR-23-198,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

For instance, the extent and manner in which natural selection affects genetic diversity remains highly controversial. Researchers have largely addressed this problem by developing statistical tests or summaries of genome sequence variation that provide insights into the evolutionary forces at play. However, because such approaches typically rely on a single univariate summary of the data, valuable discriminatory information present in the original dataset is lost. A more fruitful strategy would thus be to use multidimensional summaries of genomic data (e.g. a large vector of summary statistics) or even the totality of the input data (e.g. a matrix-representation of a sequence alignment) to make more accurate inferences. An even more powerful approach is to utilize data sets in which the same population is sampled at multiple time points, allowing one to observe evolutionary dynamics in action. Although such genomic time-series data are becoming more prevalent, the development of appropriate computational methodologies has lagged behind the proliferation of such data. Proposal: The Schrider Lab seeks to develop and apply powerful machine learning methods for evolutionary inference. Our work over the next five years will yield powerful software tools leveraging novel representations of genomic datasets, including time-series data. These efforts will dramatically improve researchers' ability to make accurate evolutionary inferences from both population genomic and phylogenetic data. Indeed, preliminary results demonstrate that our methods vastly outperform current approaches in evolutionary genetics. More importantly, we will use these tools to answer pressing evolutionary questions. In particular, our use of time-series data will reveal loci responsible for recent adaptation with much greater confidence than currently possible. Our efforts will help to resolve the controversy over the role of adaptation in shaping patterns of diversity across the human genome. This research has important implications for public health as well, as genes underlying recent adaptations are enriched for disease-associations. Moreover, we are constructing a time-series dataset in the mosquito vector species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. We will interrogate these data for evidence of recent and ongoing adaptation-this work will reveal loci responsible for the evolution of resistance to insecticides and other control efforts. Encouraging preliminary data also suggest that our work in phylogenetics will substantially improve inferential power in this important research area. More broadly, the success of the novel approaches described in this proposal has the potential to transform the methodological landscape of evolutionary genomic data analysis.",5,5R35GM138286-05,PAR-17-190,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,11,8,2,0

We theorize that across individuals, heterogeneous neural underpinnings manifest at a systems level, leading to impaired domains of function and specific diagnoses. This heterogeneity causes the same intervention to produce different outcomes across individuals. To overcome this challenge, we hypothesize that systems-level brain activity (neural oscillations) contains the information necessary to predict both individual variation in a domain of brain function and identify biomarkers to guide the individualized implementation of an intervention. To test these hypotheses, a model brain system is needed with sufficient variation and complexity to produce heterogeneity in behavior and intervention outcomes. Prior work, including our own preliminary data, demonstrates such behavioral variation exists across individuals and sexes in an outbred rat strain (Sprague Dawley) performing the delay discounting task (RDT (delay discounting task (RDT) and risk discounting task (RDT (risk discounting task (RDT). When brain stimulation (Aim 1), pharmacologic (Aim 2) or chemogenetic (Aim 3) interventions have been implemented in these rats, they produce heterogeneous effects on task (RDT performance across individuals making this an excellent model system to evaluate our hypotheses. Our proposed proof-of-concept study will determine the potential utility of neural oscillations as biomarkers reflecting individual variation in the neural underpinnings of delay and risk discounting and the predisposition of those individuals to respond to interventions. We will use machine learning to determine if: 1) oscillations can predict variation in task (RDT performance across individuals and time; 2) oscillations can predict individual intervention outcomes; and 3) changes in oscillations induced by interventions are predictive of corresponding changes in delay discounting task (RDT or risk discounting task (RDT performance. Further enhancing the translational relevance of this proposal, the neural systems that modulate the value of rewards associated with delay and risk discounting share homology between rodents and humans and have been linked to important clinical outcomes. For instance, the excessive reduction of reward value by delay relates to a significant risk for poor outcomes in multiple psychiatric conditions (e.g., ADHD, schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder). Abnormal delay and risk discounting have also been linked to specific behaviors, including suicide, violence and risky substance use, enhancing the impact of the proposed studies. As an early-career investigator, funding for this proposal would allow me to launch an innovative translational research program aligned with NIMH strategic goals focused on developing systemslevel brain activity biomarkers to guide the individualized implementation of interventions for patients with mental illness.",5,5R01MH134141-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,5,1

Adding to this challenge is the fact that neural function does not operate in isolation but rather within living, behaving animals. Great technological advances over the past decades have allowed researchers to begin to optically measure and modulate neural activity but these approaches are often limited to head-fix animals when studying neural function at spatial and temporal scales relevant to internal neural circuit dynamics. While a great deal of scientific and technological progress has been made, there is still much to learn concerning complex neural function, especially within the context of natural behavior. This knowledge gap, at least in part, is due to a lack of accessible tools for simultaneously modulating and observing large-scale neural circuits with single-cell precision in freely behaving animals. This project will fill this gap by developing open-source, head-mounted miniature microscopes with spatiotemporal illumination capabilities for both patterned photo-stimulation and improved neural imaging in freely behaving animals. We will develop a modular control and acquisition platform for native integration of neural and behavioral equipment to facilitate neural-behavioral experiments. Finally, this platform will be driven by a novel, automated, closed-loop processing framework for detecting, decoding, and manipulating neural and behavioral dynamics in real-time. The goal of this platform is to 1) significantly extend and improve upon current freely behaving neural imaging and modulation techniques and 2) provide an integrated framework for observing, controlling, and manipulating neural dynamics within the context of behavior. This approach has the potential to simultaneously ""read"" from and ""write"" into, potentially, any area of the brain, enabling fine-grained investigation of the causal role between neural activity and behavior. Our development will be guided by concurrent benchtop and in vivo testing at every stage of the development and optimization process. To maximize the impact of our efforts, all tools and technologies developed for this proposal will be open-source and shared widely with the scientific community through online resources and technical workshops.",5,5U01NS126050-03,RFA-NS-18-019,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

This phenotype variation is thought to be caused in part by common variants and variants with subtle effects, but the potential deterministic roles of such modifier alleles have not been rigorously or systematically studied in clinical settings. Toward the long-term goal of deciphering the genetic basis of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity in human monogenic diseases, this proposal aims to study patients with recurrent genomic disorders in whom identical genomic rearrangements manifest disease phenotypes in an incompletely penetrant manner. The overall objective of this proposed project is to formulate a generalizable approach using cohorts of patients with recurrent large genomic deletions that can identify and characterize clinically significant disease-modifying variants. The central hypothesis is that patients with recurrent large genomic deletions offer an effective genomic background to identify disease-modifying alleles that serve as reliable predictors of disease outcome in individual patients. This central hypothesis will be tested by defining the genetic determinants of specific phenotype presentations at two genomic loci: early onset diabetes at 17q12 and abnormal head size at 1q21.1. Large-scale patient resources will be gathered based on molecular information made available by clinical diagnostics. Recruited patients will be analyzed at the molecular level by whole genome sequencing. Phenotype-genotype correlation analysis will be performed to identify candidate modifier alleles under different disease-modifying models based on preliminary data from each disease locus. Functional validation of selected disease-modifying alleles will be performed using patientderived induced pluripotent stem cells. The innovation of this study lies in the assembly of rare personal genomes with identical copy number variants from clinical diagnostic databases to enable a human subject ""enhancer screen."" The proposed research is significant because it is expected to identify clinically important alleles in recurrent deletion loci whose presence or absence can be used for precise diagnosis, counseling and management for patients with genetic disorders. The research strategy utilized herein could be generalized to other phenotypes or genomic loci, and the general mechanisms discovered will be directly applicable to understanding incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity in human diseases.",5,5R35HG011311-04,RFA-HG-18-006,NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE,11,8,2,0

Despite surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, as many as 50% of patients can show occult disseminated disease, with only a 43% survival rate. Furthermore, systemic chemotherapy can have toxic side effects. Thus, recent efforts have aimed at improving detection and treatment of micromets. Chemophototherapy (Chemophototherapy), the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy, is an emerging cancer treatment modality that can provide synergistic efficacy of both therapies. The overall goal is to implement a quantitative laparoscopic imaging and treatment approach for advanced detection of micromets and optimization of Chemophototherapy for targeted destruction of ovarian micromets and reduced toxic side effects. Quantitative fluorescence laparoscopic imaging will provide high sensitivity and resolution for detecting micromets as well as image guided drug delivery. Folate receptor alpha (Folate receptor alpha) will be used as a promising target because it is highly specific of epithelial ovarian cancer. The proposed targeted Chemophototherapy compound has a ~6-fold tumor-specificity providing enhanced fluorescence contrast. These folate-targeted, porphyrin-phospholipid doped liposomes are triggered directly by near infrared (near infrared) light. This activates the anti-cancer photosensitizer outer layer and releases the anti-cancer agent Doxorubicinorubicin (Doxorubicin). While this nanocarrier is expected to improve detection of micromets, tissue absorption and scattering in living tissue can confound fluorescence contrast. Quantitative imaging based on spatial frequency domain imaging can eliminate these confounding effects and provide quantitative contrasts to enable more sensitive detection compared to raw fluorescence or white light visualization. Furthermore, this quantitative capability can function in near-real-time to provide feedback on drug release, thus allowing image-guided optimization of treatment light to ensure full drug release within each tumor. In Aim 1, a wide-field dual-channel laparoscope, fast quantification algorithms and targeted liposomal nano-construct will be implemented and optimized. In Aim 2, the platform will be validated in vivo for improved detection of micromets vs. raw fluorescence and white light. In Aim 3, the platform's efficacy will be validated in vivo for destroying micromets in targeted tumors while reducing toxicity to surrounding normal tissues. Successful completion of this approach is expected to result in improved detection and treatment of micromets with reduced side effects. This is ultimately expected to lead to reduced recurrence rates and overall improved survival. Although this imaging approach focuses on epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment, it can be applicable to a wide range of epithelial diseases, such as oral, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers.",5,5R01CA243164-05,PAR-19-158,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,17,0,4,4

Over the past half-century, our understanding of such symmetry-breaking has been predominantly developed through molecular, genetic, and cellular frameworks. However, symmetry-breaking in developing organs occurs at scales far larger than their individual molecular and cellular constituents, prompting the question of how events at the molecular and cellular scale relate to the physical self-organization of organ structure. To address this question, my lab centers its studies on the behavior of cell collectives, an understudied nexus that serves as a mediator between subcellular processes and functionally relevant organ morphology. Our prior work in considering collective cell, or supracellular, material properties has led to the hypothesis that the role of key signals, known as morphogens, in sculpting organs is to influence cells and extracellular matrix such that tissue material properties or ""phase"" are modulated. Thus, a key functional role of morphogens may be to create diversity in supracellular mechanical behavior by fluidizing or solidifying tissue domains that result in the increase of complexity in organ form. Here we will use a unique set of supracellular behavioral assays to investigate new roles for signals in shaping emerging morphologies. We will first link where and when morphogens are expressed in the forming follicle to the transcriptional profiles and multicellular architectures that accompany morphogen activity (Aim 1). We will then leverage a constellation of novel collective cell mechanics platforms to probe the functional consequence of morphogen activity at the supracellular scale. (Aim 2). Finally, through the integration of theory and experiment, we will explore the hypothesis that interacting supracellular phases generate a mechanical instability in the skin that is sufficient to shape the organ (Aim 3). Together these studies stand to highlight the need to consider supracellular properties necessary for tissue symmetry breaking that are not reducible to the properties of individual cells. At the same time, our studies will identify the molecular and cellular component parts that enable the diversification of emergent supracellular material properties. Our investigations will pave the way for a generalizable paradigm for how morphogens can create adjacent material phases within a single tissue, thereby generating the potential for mechanical selforganization at the tissue scale. Finally, these studies will shed light on the multi-scale nature of organ formation and serve as a foundation for future work aimed at addressing congenital defects, engineering stromal tissues of specific material properties, and the rational channeling supracellular self-organizing potential in regenerative medicine.",1,1R01GM152611-01,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,7,2,0

An example of this can be found in recent attempts to target the serine synthesis pathway for cancer therapy, where the abundance of serine available to be taken up from the circulation has hampered the success of inhibitors of serine biosynthesis. This places a premium on pursuing strategies of limiting pathway redundancy if we wish to successfully target serine and other critical metabolic pathways for cancer therapy. We have taken the approach of analyzing human tumor gene expression data to identify scenarios where pathway redundancy is limited due to lineage-dependent gene expression, thereby creating potential vulnerabilities. Using this approach, we have found that the two major lineages of breast tumors-luminal and basal-express vastly different levels of PSAT1 (phosphoserine aminotransferase 1), the gene encoding the second enzyme of the serine synthesis pathway. Luminal breast cancer cells, which express extremely low levels of PSAT1, are unable to activate the serine synthesis pathway even when extracellular serine is completely absent. As a result, they are entirely dependent on exogenous serine for proliferation and survival. This is in contrast to basal breast cancer cells, which are able to synthesize serine and proliferate in the absence of extracellular serine. Mechanistically, this serine auxotrophy appears to be due to luminal-specific methylation of the PSAT1 gene. Based on this data, we have developed the hypothesis that lineage-specific epigenetic silencing of the PSAT1 gene induces serine auxotrophy in luminal breast tumors and makes them vulnerable to inhibition of serine uptake. In this proposal, we will 1) determine whether luminal breast tumors are sensitive to dietary serine starvation in vivo, 2) define the mechanism of PSAT1 suppression in luminal tumors, and 3) identify and characterize serine transporters as potential pharmacological targets of this vulnerability. While luminal breast cancer patients initially have a favorable prognosis due to the utility of endocrine therapies, over half of all patients eventually develop resistance to these therapies and undergo relapse. As a result, over half of all breast cancer fatalities are due to luminal breast cancer, making this an area of significant unmet clinical need. The experiments described in this proposal have the potential to identify new therapeutic options for patients with advanced luminal breast cancer.",5,5R37CA251216-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

The secondary events such as cerebral hyperglycolysis and mitochondrial failure develop over minutes to months after the primary injury, providing a potential window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Given early, this intervention may prevent or reduce secondary brain damage, directly impacting long-term patient outcome. Therefore, the noninvasive detection and characterization of pathophysiology in traumatic brain injury patients during the acute and early sub-acute stages, will have critical clinical implications for the early diagnosis of individuals with the highest risk of poor neurological outcomes and will be vital for identifying and developing effective therapies. While a number of pathological alternations in traumatic brain injury are potential biomarkers, no current clinical imaging modalities are sensitive enough to be routinely used to detect the details of metabolic shifts in brain sub-regions with secondary injury. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging) of hyperpolarized 13C-labeled substrates provides unique noninvasive measurements of critical in vivo dynamic metabolic processes. In particular, pyruvate occupies a key nodal point in cerebral energy metabolism, among the fates of [1-13C]pyruvate are reduction to lactate as the end product of glycolysis, conversion in mitochondria to form acetyl-CoA and CO2 (detected as HCO3-) via pyruvate dehydrogenase (pyruvate dehydrogenase) flux or anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylase (pyruvate carboxylase) pathway for oxidative phosphorylation. [2-13C]pyruvate, on the other hand, directly assess the tricarboxylic acid (tricarboxylic acid) cycle by detecting [5-13C]glutamate production. While our preliminary data demonstrated increased lactate and decreased HCO3- (bicarbonate) production from hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate in a rat traumatic brain injury model and acute traumatic brain injury patients, however, the role of [13C]HCO3as a tricarboxylic acid cycle marker needs further verification due to the high pyruvate carboxylation. Another key metabolic alteration following traumatic brain injury is increased acetate oxidation in astrocytes, playing a neuro-protective role. The increased acetate metabolism tightly interacts with pyruvate metabolism, and thus, should be considered together when interpreting [13C]pyruvate metabolism. The fundamental goal of this project is to understand how traumatic brain injury influences the in vivo cellular metabolism in the brain using hyperpolarized 13C Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging as a step towards personalizing therapy for traumatic brain injury patients. In this proposal, a comprehensive analysis of traumatic brain injury metabolism will be performed using a rat traumatic brain injury model by comparing the in vivo imaging results with ex vivo tissue analysis. First, we will develop hyperpolarized [2-13C]pyruvate as a probe to directly measure the altered tricarboxylic acid cycle activity in traumatic brain injury (aim 1). Second, we will assess the contribution of increased acetate metabolism to pyruvate oxidation in a rat traumatic brain injury model (aim 2). The longitudinal in vivo imaging data (aims 1&2) will be validated by cross-sectional ex vivo NMR isotopomer analysis of freeze-clamped brain tissues. Finally, we will translate the technique to assess metabolic changes in acute mild traumatic brain injury patients (aim 3).",5,5R01NS107409-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,2,6,6,1

With a groundbreaking combination of conceptual and methodological innovations, we will specifically identify the modifications of synaptic function that correspond to changes in behavioral state and perceptual learning. Specifically, we propose to monitor variation in synaptic release probability, potency, and integration for targeted circuits within the mouse visual cortex, relating these properties to behavioral state transitions and enhanced perceptual ability associated with visuomotor learning.

Poor loading capacity of silica nanoparticles, their stability and vacuolization in macrophages, and potentially lower metabolism and clearance rates in patient populations may necessitate administration of high and frequent doses of silica nanoparticles which could lead to mononuclear phagocytic system saturation and overload. Detailed investigation of immunotoxicity of silica nanoparticles in the mononuclear phagocytic system is needed to establish their safety profile to choose drug carriers with well-defined immunological properties. The influence of silica nanoparticles on the fate and function of phagocytes after uptake and saturation, and on host immune response need further elucidation. The correlation between the physicochemical properties of silica nanoparticles and the mechanisms of sex-dependent toxicity is unclear. Also, the immune response alteration upon i.v. administration of silica nanoparticles and the mechanisms behind this response are largely unknown. To address these knowledge gaps in this grant application the following Specific Aims are proposed: 1) To investigate the influence of saturation of macrophages with silica nanoparticles on their phagocytic activity, survival, proliferation, and immune signaling as a function of nanoparticle physicochemical properties. The underlying hypothesis to be tested in this aim is that saturation of macrophages by silica nanoparticles will influence their normal function, molecular signaling, and fate based on nanoparticle characteristics. 2) To investigate bone marrow toxicity and function of tissue-resident macrophages after i.v. administration of silica nanoparticles, and assess the number and activation status of circulating phagocytes after in vitro exposure to silica nanoparticles. The underlying hypothesis to be tested in this aim is that size, geometry, and porosity of silica nanoparticles influence the normal function of bone marrow, tissue-resident macrophages, and peripheral blood phagocytes, a phenomenon which may be reversible and depend on dose and frequency of administration. 3) To investigate the immune side effects and anti-PEG response of systemically administered silica nanoparticles as a function of animal sex and particle physicochemical properties. The underlying hypotheses are: i) Anti-PEG IgM and IgG will be generated in a time-dependent manner upon exposure to PEGylated silica nanoparticles; ii) variation in immune response in female vs male Th1 and Th2 bias animal models will contribute to SNP toxicity and immunemediated side effects. This proposal is significant because understanding key physicochemical properties of silica nanoparticles with welldefined immunological properties will help establish safer platforms for intravenous drug delivery.

Two key hurdles for therapies for metastatic breast cancer (metastatic breast cancer) patients are to treat brain metastases (brain metastases) and to prevent progression of bone metastases (bone metastases). Chemotherapeutic drugs, including the taxanes, remain mainline therapies for stage IV patients with metastatic breast cancer. However, prolonged clinical use of taxanes is associated with development of multidrug resistance, dose-limiting hematopoietic toxicity, and neurotoxicity. Our ongoing efforts in this area has led to an investigational new drug, Sabizabulin. Use of Sabizabulin in metastatic breast cancer and other tumor models demonstrated suppression of primary tumor growth and tumor metastasis, and effectiveness in overcoming taxane resistance. Since Sabizabulin has limited brain penetration, its further modification led to the discovery of SB-216, a highly brain penetrable analog that has excellent efficacy in multiple taxane-resistant tumor models. To further develop the SB-216 scaffold for metastatic breast cancer, the goals of this project are to:  perform focused structural optimization based on the SB-216 scaffold to produce new potent and high brain penetrable analogs that can overcome taxane resistance for metastatic breast cancer brain metastases management; and  develop novel drug conjugates with bisphosphonate (bisphosphonate) for metastatic breast cancer bone bone metastases treatment. AIM 1. Perform focused structure-based optimization based on the SB-216 scaffold to develop new analogs with high brain penetration ability. Crystal structures of tubulin/SB-216 complexes will be used to guide focused, iterative lead optimization. We will screen new analogs in vitro using a panel of metastatic breast cancer cell lines, including cells derived from PDX models, and normal cells. We will determine their brain penetrations to select the ten best compounds for in vivo efficacy studies. AIM 2. Determine the in vivo efficacy of selected SB-216 analogs for suppressing metastatic breast cancer brain metastases. We will first determine the maximum tolerable dose and pharmacokinetics for selected SB-216 analogs from Aim 1 to identify the overall best three analogs for in vivo evaluation using multiple well-characterized, pre-clinical models of metastatic breast cancer, including taxane-refractory models, each with pre-existing brain metastases to score for delay of metastatic progression. AIM 3. Conjugate Sabizabulin, SB-216 and its new analogs with bisphosphonate for more efficacious targeting of metastatic breast cancer bone metastases, using the best Sabizabulin conjugate and paclitaxel as the references. Conjugating Sabizabulin, SB-216, or its new analogs with a bisphosphonate drug with very high affinity to bones will increase the efficacy of treating bone metastases. Thus, we will optimize the linker chemistry and evaluate a variety of bisphosphonate drugs for conjugation. Conjugates will first be evaluated in vitro for stability and activation to select the two best conjugates for further in vivo efficacy studies using BonMet pre-clinical models.

Intravascular hemolysis associated with mechanical circulatory support devices produces free hemoglobin (free hemoglobin). Adsorption of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (von Willebrand factor) onto non-biological surfaces captures platelets that may aggregate. We reported that high levels of free hemoglobin increased von Willebrand factormediated platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on fibrin(ogen)-coated surfaces at high shear stress. Importantly, free hemoglobin increased the flow-dependent adhesion of formalin fixed platelets to a von Willebrand factor coated surface, suggesting that free hemoglobin directly enhances the von Willebrand factorglycoprotein (GP)Ib interaction. von Willebrand factor deficiency or antibodies against GPIb block the enhancement of platelet adhesion by free hemoglobin, validating the role of von Willebrand factor. Lastly, our identification of ultra large von Willebrand factor (ULvon Willebrand factor) in whole blood exposed to free hemoglobin and high shear rates suggests that platelet derived ULvon Willebrand factor may contribute to the pathology of thrombosis in the presence of high levels of free hemoglobin. Together, these findings provide the first evidence that high levels of free hemoglobin are critical for von Willebrand factor-mediated thrombosis on surfaces coated with fibrin(ogen), and that ULvon Willebrand factor multimers from shear-activated platelets may enhance thrombosis more robustly than plasma von Willebrand factor in the presence of free hemoglobin. Our overarching hypothesis is that free hemoglobin targets von Willebrand factor, including the platelet-derived von Willebrand factor, to promote platelet adhesion via GPIb, and potentiate fibrin formation by facilitating the binding of von Willebrand factor to fibrinogen. We propose molecular, biochemical, and structural studies to investigate the mechanisms by which free hemoglobin dysregulates the interactions between von Willebrand factor, fibrin(ogen), and platelets. Aim 1 will investigate the contributions of platelet von Willebrand factor vs. plasma von Willebrand factor to thrombosis. We will test the hypotheses that free hemoglobin interaction with platelet von Willebrand factor enhances platelet adhesion to fibrin(ogen) and potentiates fibrin formation more robustly than plasma von Willebrand factor. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that free hemoglobin-bound von Willebrand factor has a conformation that favors platelet adhesion. Aim 3 will determine the mechanism by which free hemoglobin dysregulate von Willebrand factor-fibrin(ogen) interaction. We will test the hypotheses that free hemoglobin promotes von Willebrand factor-fibrin(ogen) association and modulates the von Willebrand factor-mediated fibrin formation. These studies will describe new mechanisms related to thrombosis in patients on mechanical circulatory support devices and identify new, potential targets for therapeutic interventions in free hemoglobin-induced thrombosis.",5,5R01HL154688-04,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",3,4,0,0

Hence, many candidates are faced with the decision to relinquish their remaining acoustic hearing in exchange for electric hearing via the cochlear implant (cochlear implant). A potential solution is a stimulation strategy termed Electric acoustic stimulation (Electric acoustic stimulation), which has been used to describe the ipsilateral combination of electric hearing via a cochlear implant and acoustic hearing via a hearing aid. This, however, requires preservation of residual hearing, which has been possible but inconsistent. A new technology to potentially improve hearing preservation, intraoperative electrocochleography (electrocochleography), has been introduced and it was recently implemented into commercially available cochlear implant systems. Studies comparing Electric acoustic stimulation with conventional cochlear implant have were able to demonstrate a performance benefit of Electric acoustic stimulation. However, these studies have compared conventional cochlear implant candidates to Electric acoustic stimulation candidates with more residual hearing. Thus, the clinical importance of residual acoustic hearing in cochlear implantation (cochlear implant) remains unclear. Therefore, the present protocol seeks to answer two critical clinical questions in cochlear implantation: (Specific Aim 1) Are cochlear implant electrode insertions using Electrocochleography (electrocochleography) feedback better for achieving hearing preservation (hearing preservation) and (Specific Aim 2) is combined ipsilateral Electric acoustic stimulation better than non-hearing preservation (conventional) cochlear implantation among cochlear implant candidates with substantial residual hearing (Electric acoustic stimulation candidates). We plan to enroll and randomize Electric acoustic stimulation candidates in seven large US centers. Patients will be assigned to either intraoperative electrocochleography monitoring or conventional cochlear implant electrode insertions. Hearing preservation and other performance outcomes will be recorded and analyzed between the groups to assess the clinical value of intraoperative monitoring. Further, subjects from both groups will have either useable or no useable residual hearing as the result of surgery. Audiometric and patient reported performance outcomes will be obtained and evaluated for 24 months following initial stimulation. In summary, the present proposal aims to answer two critical clinical questions: Is cochlear implant electrode insertion based on electrocochleography better for achieving hearing preservation? and Is Electric acoustic stimulation better than conventional cochlear implantation among Electric acoustic stimulation candidates? A positive answer to these questions will inform an evidence-based clinical practice for Electric acoustic stimulation candidates that uses longer electrodes, broadens the candidate pool by including patients with greater levels of residual hearing, and potentially improves outcomes following cochlear implant.",5,5U01DC018920-05,PAR-18-340,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,0,1,5,1

Managing absorption entails not only sorting of nutrients by intestinal epithelial cells but also delivery of those nutrients to specialized blood and lymphatic vessels present in each villus of the small intestine. In turn, the blood and lymphatic vessels that collectively manage outflow from the gut may need to rely on specialized mechanisms that operate to limit dissemination of microbial signals to distal sites like the lung or the liver to avoid downstream organ injury. It is now appreciated, for instance, that alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver damage is driven substantially by microbial transit from the gut to the liver via the portal vein. Likewise, pulmonary damage can ensue in response to injurious cargo in lymph that gains access to blood via the thoracic duct and quickly next flows to the lungs. Yet mechanisms protecting against dissemination of microbial signals from the intestinal mucosa remain incompletely understood, possibly making planned manipulations of the mucosal barrier, as in vaccination or disease therapy, riskier than needed or resulting in surprises. For instance, our preliminary data suggest that the documented and seemingly counterintuitive liver damage that can result from anti-TNF neutralizing antibody therapy to treat inflammatory disease of the bowel may be due, at least in part, to disruption of leukocyte-mediated surveillance of the draining venous vasculature that removes microbes that escape the intestinal mucosal before they arrive to the liver. To fill in these basic knowledge gaps, we propose herein to delineate how different regions of the intestine program leukocyte-dependent and leukocyte-independent strategies to protect downstream cells and tissues against dissemination of microbial signals. In aim 1, we focus on mechanisms operative in phagocytic removal from gut-draining venous blood of whole microbes that escape the intestinal mucosal barrier and otherwise deliver the microbes to deeper tissues or distal locations. In aim 2, we will compare how the small bowel and colon may differentially transport and neutralize soluble microbial signals, like LPS, that can inadvertently escape the epithelial barrier to promote inflammation. This effort will include comprehensive proteomic and lipidomic evaluation of lymph and blood draining different regions of the gut mucosa, working with expert collaborators and taking advantage of our laboratory's expertise in lymphatic biology and recent studies in the transport of intestinal cargo into gut-draining venous blood.",5,5U01AI163064-04,RFA-AI-20-027,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,3,4,1,3

To address this issue, flow modulation via rapid changes in pump impeller speed has been proposed as a technique to introduce 'artificial pulsatility'. However, given the inadequacy of large animal models with recreating CF-VAD associated non-surgical bleeding events, it is still unclear if artificial pulsatility can prevent these adverse events or what level of artificial pulsatility is even necessary. To evaluate the effects of pulsatility and identify promising flow modulation approaches we developed a vascular pulse perfusion model (vascular pulse perfusion model) to culture Human Aortic Endothelial Cells (Human Aortic Endothelial Cells) under conditions of normal pulsatile flow or flow with diminished pulsatility (CF-VAD support). Our rationale for modeling arterial vessels is because pulsatility primarily affects the arterial side of the circulatory system and its effects are transduced by endothelial cells that line the large arterial vessels. The vascular pulse perfusion model was validated as relevant model via direct comparison with aortic samples of patients with and without continuous flow ventricular assist devices. Our published data also shows that loss of pulsatility is associated with an increase in production of pro-angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The relevance of these results is further strengthened by supporting data from patients that experience arteriovenous malformations and gastrointestinal bleeding events (both CF-VAD related and due to other conditions) showing similar elevated levels of proangiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The vascular pulse perfusion model therefore provides a powerful model to evaluate artificial pulsatility in the context of CF-VAD flow modulation and determine if restoring pulse pressure and/or pulse frequency can mitigate non-surgical bleeding events. Based on recent studies that suggest that pulse pressure < 35 mmHg is a major risk factor for development of gastrointestinal bleeds, we hypothesize that ""Diminished pulsatility associated with 'CF-VAD support' results in endothelial dysfunction and pro-inflammatory/pro-angiogenic soluble factor production. These changes can be mitigated via introduction of artificial pulsatility using flow modulation strategies where pulse pressure is preserved at > 35 mmHg"". Aim1 will evaluate response of patient derived endothelial cells within the vascular pulse perfusion model to CF-VAD flow and quantify angiogenic/inflammatory soluble factor production, Aim2 will follow patients for up to 36 months to evaluate serum levels of pro-angiogenic/proinflammatory cytokines and non-surgical bleeding events which will then be compared to results from in-vitro studies within the vascular pulse perfusion model and Aim3 will evaluate different flow modulation strategies using patient-derived endothelial cells to determine most promising patient-specific approaches via comparison of hemodynamic profiles and cytokine biomarkers using deep learning approaches. Successful completion of this project will enable identification of device-based strategies to prevent non-surgical bleeding in patients on CF-VAD support.",5,5R01HL151663-04,PA-19-056,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,2,0,0

For DMD gene therapy, the possibility of T-cell responses to pre-existing (from revertant fibers) &/or post-treatment dystrophin epitopes has recently emerged as a serious treatment issue. In the past year 5 DMD patients treated with AAV-microdystrophin (μDys) have developed T cell mediated immune responses against dystrophin. Based on immunological data, in all cases the antigenic region was highly suggested to be encoded by exons 8-11.1 Additionally, to being observed in patients deleted for this region (updates provided at MDA and ASGCT 2022 scientific conferences). A key component of our approach takes advantage of the fact that a single amino acid can anchor a novel peptide for a preferred binding state for antigen presenting cells' via its major histocompatibility complex (major histocompatibility complex) and subsequent T cell receptor (T cell receptor). It is the T cell receptor recognition which leads to downstream signaling cascades and immune sequelae. Alternatively, conservatively modified residue(s), can disfavor antigen presentation, preventing dystrophinspecific immunity. Thus, avoidance of a specific immune response can be achieved if key epitope anchor residue(s) necessary for antigen presentation are modified to disrupt major histocompatibility complex recognition. Here, our proposal addresses the fundamental role of immunogenicity against dystrophin that has been found in DMD patients. This proposal integrates deimmunization protocols and structure-based protein redesign via Rosetta-software, with streamlined functional testing via our magnetic tissue array (magnetic tissue array) platform-allowing for daily 3D DMD contractile performance assessment in-a-dish. In turn, dystrophin epitopes can be predicted & ranked according to their antigenicity by correlating their amino acid sequence content with immunological databases. Known and predicted epitopes will be targeted for redesign to reduce or eliminate putative major histocompatibility complex-binding peptides and subsequent T cell activation. Our deimmunization approach will build on previous efforts while focusing on exons 8-11 of dystrophin, & integrating data as it becomes available through any DMD clinical trial alliance that unfolds. The exon 8-11 region, now part of Pfizers' updated patient exclusion criteria, encodes a portion of the actinbinding domain, extending through spectrin-like repeat 1 (note: we have already deimmunized much of exons 68). Importantly, restricting deimmunization efforts to exons 8-11 of dystrophin would be beneficial for all μDys designs currently in clinical trials. In summary, we propose to deliver deimmunized μDys vectors to human DMD 3D engineered muscle tissues and measure contractile force(s) via our magnetic tissue array system in an effort to screen for highly functional leading candidates with reduced immunogenicity. To fully validate our 3D muscle system as a predictive model we will test optimized candidates(s) via rAAV vectors driven by highly muscle specific regulatory cassettes for their capacity to ameliorate disease progression in the DMDmdx rat model of DMD.

The End HIV Epidemic (End HIV Epidemic) Toolkit recommends that jails offer low-barrier access to HIV testing, treatment, and prevention to people who inject opioids, but many justice-involved people with opioid use disorder (opioid use disorder) do not know their HIV status and few access medications to prevent HIV (pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP). Suffolk County, the only End HIV Epidemic-designated jurisdiction in Massachusetts (Massachusetts), had a recent HIV outbreak, occurring in formerly incarcerated people with opioid use disorder, that disproportionately impacted three geographically and racially distinct communities (Boston, Chelsea, Revere). Improvements were made to increase carceral HIV prevention and care, but one year into implementation only about 10% were HIV tested and few were initiated on PrEP. Massachusetts Medicaid now authorizes coverage of HIV care before, upon, and following release from incarceration, but HIV care is not well-integrated with the jails' existing medications for opioid use disorder (Mopioid use disorder) program and there are gaps between jails and community healthcare. The Massachusetts HIV/Justice Research Network proposes to partner with the Suffolk jail system and community treatment partners to conduct a formative evaluation and pilot (R61, Aim 1) and type 2 hybrid implementationeffectiveness study (R33, Aims 2-4) of a multi-pronged intervention to increase HIV testing and PrEP linkage called ID Testing OUtreach in Carceral Hubs (ID Testing OUtreach in Carceral Hubs).

This project seeks to elucidate the contribution of two families of lipids, isolevuglandins (isolevuglandins) and Nacylethanolamides (Nacylethanolamides), that potentially interact through HDL to altered macrophage efferocytic function, as well as the role of Nape-pld, an enzyme that catalyzes both the formation of Nacylethanolamides and the degradation of the isolevuglandins adducts. We hypothesize that under normal conditions HDL promotes the ability of macrophages to carry out efferocytosis by 1) accepting the cholesterol that macrophages take up during phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and 2) delivering NAE precursors to macrophages which use their Nape-pld to hydrolyze these precursors to Nacylethanolamides which can promote expression of genes needed for efferocytosis. We hypothesize that in conditions that promote atherosclerosis, HDL becomes modified by isolevuglandins which retards efferocytosis by 1) inhibiting HDL's ability to accept cholesterol and 2) creating ligands recognized by pattern recognition receptors that drive macrophages to a pro-inflammatory phenotype with high expression of inflammatory cytokines and low expression of proteins needed for efferocytosis. Thus, isolevuglandins modification of HDL and reduced Nape-pld expression combine to suppress the efferocytic capacity of macrophages, leading to the formation and expansion of necrotic cores which create vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. We will test this hypothesis as follows: Aim 1 will determine if apoAI lysine residues critical to cholesterol efflux are modified by isolevuglandins during development of atherosclerosis. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanisms whereby HDL modified by lipid dicarbonyls potentiate inflammation in macrophages and determine if these alterations contribute to reduced efferocytosis.

The current approaches rely on substitute markers such as action potential duration or QT interval prolongation on the ECG. There is an urgent need to identify a new approach that can predict actual proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry rather than relying on surrogate indicators. We have brought together an expert team to innovate at the interfaces of experimental and computational modeling disciplines and develop an in silico simulation pipeline to predict cardiotoxicity over multiple temporal and spatial scales from the atom to the cardiac rhythm. An essential and unique aspect of our approach is that we propose to utilize atomistic scale simulation to predict the transition rates of ion channels and adrenergic receptors and how they are modified by drug interaction. We hypothesize that it is the subtleties of these interactions that are likely to be the critical determinants of drug associated safety or proarrhythmia. In the last award period, we successfully developed an unprecedented linkage: We connected the highly disparate space and time scales of ion channel structure and function. We utilized atomistic simulation to compute drug kinetic rates were directly used as parameters in a hERG function model. The model components were then integrated into predictive models at the cell and tissue scales to expose fundamental arrhythmia vulnerability mechanisms and complex interactions underlying emergent behaviors. Human clinical data were used for model validation and showed excellent agreement, demonstrating feasibility of this new approach for cardiotoxicity prediction. In this renewal application we propose to hugely extend this approach to include prediction of the interaction of cardiac channel gating and drug interaction as well as the inclusion of adrenergic receptor interactions with drugs. Another essential aspect of safety pharmacology is the development of new approaches to allow more efficient drug design, screening and prediction of cardiotoxicity. Therefore, we will seek to develop, extend and apply a variety of machine learning and deep learning approaches to improve drug discovery by predicting proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry with an efficient process that identify drug congeners via machine learning to maximize therapy and minimize side effects. Finally, we propose to classify drugs into categories based on proarrhythmia risk in normal and diseased virtual tissue settings. The multiscale model for prediction of cardiopharmacology that we will develop in this application will be applied to projects demonstrating its usefulness for efficacy or toxicity of drug treatments in the complex physiological system of the heart.",5,5R01HL128537-08,PA-19-056,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,2,0,0

Integrated analyses of epigenome and epitranscriptome changes are urgently needed to have a complete molecular profile of cellular changes and to understand the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation. Yet, standard sequencing methods are unable to capture the full complexity of the epigenome (DNA modifications and chromatin accessibility) or the epitranscriptome (RNA modification). Problems inherent to current Illumina-based sequencing include: introduction of PCR bias, short-length of the reads, and the inability to directly sequence RNA molecules. To address these needs, we are developing experimental and computational approaches that allow us to (a) simultaneously detect, in vivo, DNA modifications and DNA accessibility on long stretches of single DNA molecule sequences and correlate these changes with effects on the epitranscriptome by (b) directly profiling full-length alternative RNA isoforms, RNA edits, and RNA modifications from single RNA molecule sequences. Our combined approach will rely on Oxford Nanopore long-read technologies which is capable of distinguishing modified bases in DNA and RNA, and on in vivo methods of marking accessible regions of chromatin.

Staphylococcal biofilms are highly adhesive and cohesive communities of surfaceadherent bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotic action and host immune responses, often resulting in recalcitrant infections. Specifically, the research will focus on the large, multi-domain cell wallanchored protein Aap from S. epidermidis, its ortholog SasG from S. aureus, and another large S. aureus cell wallanchored protein called SasC; each of these is known to mediate homophilic interactions that promote intercellular adhesion. Mechanisms of both reversible self-assembly and nucleation of functional amyloid fibrils will be studied in order to identify avenues for therapeutic intervention to prevent biofilm formation. In addition, the small, secreted S. epidermidis protein SBP and its ortholog from S. aureus will be investigated in terms of their ability to interact with Aap (and SasG) to facilitate assembly and potentially trigger liquid-liquid phase separation of macromolecular components in the biofilm matrix. Finally, the S. aureus protein SasX, implicated in the spread of a recent epidemic of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, is also cell wall-anchored but unlike the other cell wallanchored proteins is a small, intrinsically disordered protein. SasX will be assessed for its ability to interact with other staphylococcal surface proteins as well as keratinocyte ligands, given its demonstrated role in promoting biofilm formation as well as facilitating adhesion to epithelial cells and nasal colonization. In addition to structural and biophysical studies of these proteins, quantitative analysis of biofilm morphology and mechanical properties using confocal microscopy, rheometry, and force spectroscopy will provide complementary insights in a biological context. Over the next five years, our goal is to provide a structural and functional view of how the most important surface proteins in S. aureus and S. epidermidis physically hold the cells together in biofilms and to understand how those protein-protein interactions mechanically strengthen the biofilm.

These molecules are used for communication both on a local level and at a systemic level, where they regulate and mediate developmental, physiological, and behavioral events. Molecules like neuropeptides are packaged in specialized cellular compartments called Dense Core Vesicles (Dense Core Vesicles). Despite decades of research, little is known about the in vivo biology of Dense Core Vesicles, from the mechanism governing their sorting into appropriate cargo, to how they are properly processed into mature bioactive peptides, to how they undergo release from cells. There are hundreds of different neuropeptides in the human brain, most with completely unique cellular and physiological impacts. Some of society's most severe and debilitating diseases and conditions including neurodegenerative and neurological disorders result from abnormalities in the packaging or release of these molecules. The long-term objective of this research seeks to understand the molecular machinery regulating the synthesis, sorting, trafficking, and release of neuropeptides from Dense Core Vesicles. To initially investigate this process, we created 14 different transgenically tagged NP Drosophila fly lines to directly visualize the intracellular localization, sorting, trafficking, and release of neuropeptides from neurons in an in vivo system. We initially uncovered evidence that individual neuropeptides are sorted on an mRNA level to regulate the identity of each DCV. In Aim 1 we propose to solidify this result by creating several new transgenic fly lines using the most novel and modern cloning approaches like tissue specific CRISPR and newly created fluorescent tags like mScarlett3. This approach will tag endogenous neuropeptides within the genome and facilitate a real-time examination of their sorting, trafficking, and release mechanisms when combined with out high-resolution-ultra fast fluorescence microscopy. Aims 1 and 2 use genetic, biomolecular, cloning, electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches combined with confocal and live imaging in an in vivo system to define the proteins and processes involved in NP sorting in the trans-Golgi network. We predict that the complex of proteins found on each DCV is unique to the NP within, and this NP-dependent protein complex defines the machinery used for downstream trafficking and release. We have identified a subset of proteins known to regulate trafficking and release (e.x. synaptotagmin) and will genetically alter the structure of these proteins to identify their roles. Mutations in synaptotagmins in humans lead to severe neurodegenerative and neurological disorders like Alzheimer's. These studies will greatly advance our comprehension of NP sorting and illuminate the proteins and pathways controlling their trafficking and release from neurons.",1,1R15GM155985-01,PAR-21-155,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,7,2,1

Lymphatic vessels contract spontaneously to pump fluid, while intraluminal one-way valves ensure net forward flow. Our group and others have shown that obesity and metabolic syndrome can cause different forms of lymphatic vascular dysfunction. In fact, this connection is a dysfunctionand disease-promoting feedback loop, as lymphatic dysfunction also contributes to obesity. This suggests pharmacological improvement of lymphatic function as a potential therapeutic alternative in obesity and metabolic syndrome. Relevant to this proposal, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4) channels are key regulators of vascular function, and their activity is dysregulated in various inflammatory diseases, including obesity and metabolic syndrome; however, the role of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 channels in regulating lymphatic vascular function in health and disease remains unexplored. Our preliminary studies show that overactivity of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 channels in a variety of cell types within and around the lymphatic wall is detrimental to different aspects of the function of the lymphatic vasculature, including impairment of contractility and compromised barrier function. Importantly, partial deficiency of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 channels in the lymphatic endothelium prevented significant impairment of lymphatic function upon stimulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 channels. transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 channels have also been implicated in regulatory mechanisms of tissue fibrosis via activation of the Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1) leading to remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 is an important biomarker for disease, fibrosis, and inflammation. We recently showed that Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 is significantly increased in the lymphatic vasculature of diet-induced obese mice; and globally deficient Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 mice are significantly protected against diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In line with the emerging significant role of the lymphatic system in lipid metabolism, we hypothesize that, in obesity and metabolic syndrome, increased Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 can be a key modulator of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 overactivity, and this is detrimental for lymphatic vascular function, which reciprocally exacerbates obesity. We propose evaluating Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 as a long-term therapeutic alternative for direct or indirect modulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 activity. We anticipate that reducing inflammation and fibrosis via Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 inhibition will decrease direct activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 channels in two ways, 1) by decreasing inflammatory molecules; and 2) by reducing stiffening of the extracellular matrix, and therefore decreasing stretch-mediated activation. As important regulators of inflammatory responses, dual targeting of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 may offer synergistic therapeutic benefits, to be evaluated in this proposal. This project will provide fundamental information about transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 channels in the regulation of lymphatic vascular function and will identify the role of lymphatic transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 channels in obesity and metabolic syndrome.",5,5R01HL168568-02,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,2,0,0

Left untreated, minimal residual disease can proliferate and result in lethal cancer recurrence. Hence, there is a critical need to sensitively detect minimal residual disease in order to optimize adjuvant therapies or precision immunotherapy. Liquid biopsy offers the ability to noninvasively monitor minimal residual disease by detecting circulating tumor DNA (circulating tumor DNA) originating from cancer cells. Nonetheless, detection of circulating tumor DNA is challenging due to extremely low levels of circulating tumor DNA in low-burden disease. The prevailing paradigm argues for deep targeted sequencing of informative loci. However, we have shown that this approach faces fundamental barriers to sensitivity due to the low amount of available DNA in typical plasma samples, which imposes a physical ceiling on depth of sequencing. To overcome this challenge, our interdisciplinary team of geneticists, computer scientists, and oncologists developed minimal residual diseaseetect, an orthogonal approach for circulating tumor DNA detection based on genome-wide mutation aggregation of single-nucleotide variants (CNVs (single-nucleotide variants (CNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs (copy number variants (CNVs) using whole-genome sequencing (whole-genome sequencing) of plasma. minimal residual diseaseetect enables ultra-sensitive minimal residual disease detection down to one part in a hundred thousand, and we have demonstrated its ability to detect minimal residual disease shortly after surgery or treatment in colorectal cancer, melanoma and non small-cell lung cancer (non small-cell lung cancer). Our objective in this project is to develop crucial advances that will foster broad-based adoption of this technology across cancer settings. First, we propose to incorporate advanced machine learning (machine learning) framework known as 'deep learning' (deep learning') into the minimal residual diseaseetect platform to enable SNV identification in plasma whole-genome sequencing in low tumor burden settings (Aim 1). This will yield minimal residual diseaseetect-deep learning', which we anticipate will significantly improve cancer detection at low tumor levels through a >100-fold improvement in signal to noise enrichment compared to minimal residual diseaseetect. minimal residual diseaseetect-deep learning' performance will be tested in high-risk post-operative melanoma to define the need for adjuvant therapy, as well as in advanced melanoma treated with immunotherapy for precision immunotherapy applications. Critically, minimal residual diseaseetect-deep learning' will obviate minimal residual diseaseetect's need for a matched tumor sample, ensuring broad adoption across different clinical settings. Second, we posit that in addition to SNV-based advances, minimal residual diseaseetect's sensitivity can be increased by enhanced detection of copy number variants (CNVs, as these are broadly observed in solid tumors. We propose to develop minimal residual diseaseetect-CNV, an machine learning-denoising technique to ultra-sensitively detect small copy number variants (CNVs using plasma whole-genome sequencing (Aim 2). We will test minimal residual diseaseetect-CNV on non small-cell lung cancer plasma samples from patients undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy to define its ability to predict treatment response. Impact: Pairing minimal residual diseaseetect-deep learning' with minimal residual diseaseetect-CNV will significantly improve low burden cancer detection in adjuvant, neoadjuvant, and systemic immunotherapy, enabling broad clinical application in oncology.",5,5R01CA266619-03,PAR-19-158,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,17,0,4,4

The purpose of this application is to define an interactome on a transcript level for the primary skin pathogen, Haemophilus ducreyi (Haemophilus ducreyi), in experimentally infected human volunteers using RNA sequencing (RNA sequencing) and metabolomics. Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid, a genital ulcer (genital ulcer) disease that facilitates HIV transmission and is as a major cause of cutaneous ulcers (cutaneous ulcers) in children in yaws-endemic countries. Efforts to eradicate Haemophilus ducreyi-associated cutaneous ulcers with antibiotics failed due to environmental reservoirs. To study the biology of Haemophilus ducreyi, we developed a model in which the Haemophilus ducreyi genital ulcer strain 35000HP and its derivatives are inoculated into the skin of the upper arm of adult volunteers. Whole genome sequencing shows that most cutaneous ulcers strains are nearly identical to 35000HP, indicating that our model is highly relevant to genital ulcer and cutaneous ulcers. In the model and in natural chancroid, Haemophilus ducreyi resides in an abscess where it is surrounded by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and remains extracellular by evading phagocytosis. In our new preliminary data, we show that an interaction network exists between Haemophilus ducreyi and the host and that differential host and bacterial transcript expression correlates with metabolomic changes at infected vs. wounded sites. Haemophilus ducreyi primarily upregulates the expression of genes involved in adapting to anaerobiosis and uptake and utilization of metal ions and alternative carbon sources, such as ascorbic acid, consistent with the idea of ""nutritional virulence."" Our new metabolomics data show that ascorbic acid pathways are upregulated in lesions. Thus, we hypothesize that the host regulates its gene transcription to phagocytize and limit nutrients to Haemophilus ducreyi, that Haemophilus ducreyi regulates its gene transcription to counteract these host defenses, that host gene expression correlates with metabolomic profiles at infected sites, and that bacterial genes that are involved in adaptation to the metabolic niche created by the host response will be required for virulence. Our specific aims are 1) to define the metabolome and the interactome between Haemophilus ducreyi and the human host in infected tissue and to correlate the host transcriptional response to metabolic changes in lesions; 2) to identify the cells responsible for the host transcriptional response using single cell RNA sequencing; 3) to determine whether the Haemophilus ducreyi genes involved in exploitation of the host niche are required for virulence in humans and the mechanism(s) by which these genes contribute to virulence. The importance of this study is that we will be the first to determine an interactome at a site of a bacterial human infection, define the host cells responsible for the transcriptional response, correlate the host response to metabolomic changes in lesions, and study how Haemophilus ducreyi exploits these metabolites. We will provide new insights into the interaction between a model extracellular bacterium and the human host and unmask novel strategies to control Haemophilus ducreyi-associated cutaneous ulcers.",5,5R01AI137116-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

Although decades of research in glycobiology have established glycomic changes associated with disease, almost nothing is known about how those changes arise, the functions they play in disease initiation or progression, or how the glycome is actually regulated. Based on provocative new data, we propose a transformative new model for glycomic compositional regulation of soluble secreted glycoproteins that provides a clear path for the development of the first generation of glycan-modulating therapies for a wide range of diseases. The model is based on the notion that the glycans of glycoproteins can be remodeled after release from the originating cell, and if correct, our findings will refute the glycobiology dogma in which glycomic changes are dependent upon the slow process of protein turnover and de novo synthesis to one that is highly dynamic, rapid, and specific to the immunologic environment. The proposal centers on the molecular action, regulation and necessary microenvironment for ST6Gal1 to add α2,6-linked sialic acids onto glycans with available terminal galactose residues. Our proposal also focuses upon the B cell-secreted glycoprotein/antibody IgG. This is a critical pathway to understand because ST6Gal1 is the sole enzyme that determines whether anti-inflammatory α2,6-sialyl-IgG or pro-inflammatory asialyl-IgG is produced at any given time, thereby making it a key immunomodulatory factor. In Aim 1, we will dissect the enzymatic action of ST6Gal1 from hematopoietic cells other than B cells during IgG production. In Aim 2, we will extend our studies to the microenvironment necessary to support ST6Gal1 activity in modifying IgG sialylation. Even if our model for glycoprotein glycan remodeling is limited to sialylation, such a pathway could influence immune pathways such as leukocyte trafficking, the distinction between self and non-self by siglecs, synthesis of the ABO blood groups, transplantation, IgG functionality and many others. Our findings could redefine the nature of the glycome as one under dynamic regulation that could be therapeutically harnessed via the creation of an entirely new class of glycosylationaltering drugs for the treatment of diseases ranging from inflammatory disorders and autoimmunity to cancer.",5,5R01GM115234-08,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

The key technological gap this proposal will address is the need for systematic, high-throughput methods to define neuronal wiring diagrams at the level of defined cell types. The overall objectives of this application are to establish a suite of tools that combine spatial transcriptomics and connectomics into scalable, high-throughput methods and analytical tools for linking the molecular identities of neural cell types to their synaptic connectivity. The rationale for the proposed work is that scalable, rapid means of unraveling circuit connectivity with cell type-specificity will accelerate efforts to unravel circuit structure and function throughout the brain. These goals will be pursued in three specific aims: 1) Establish and validate a spatial transcriptomic approach, TransA-MERFISH, for multiplexed, brain-wide mapping of the postsynaptic neurons of genetically defined starter cells; 2) Establish and validate a spatial transcriptomic approach, TransRMERFISH, for multiplexed, brain-wide mapping of the presynaptic neurons of genetically defined starter cells; and 3) Establish computational platforms to decode the information gathered from TransAand TransRMERFISH. These collaborative experiments will draw on diverse expertise to merge connectomic methods developed by the applicants with spatial transcriptomic methods and analytical tools. These methods will be validated in the mouse brain, including multiple cortical and midbrain areas. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it establishes new tools to comprehensively map in situ synaptic inputs and outputs at the level of molecularly defined cell types. The proposed research will use commercial equipment to facilitate the easy adoption of these techniques by other labs. However, the approaches are also easily extensible to other spatial transcriptomics methods. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to yield a scalable, user-friendly, rapid means of unraveling circuit connectivity with cell type-specificity and defining circuit connectivity. Ultimately, the scalable tools developed here have the potential to accelerate investigations of neural circuit assembly and function in a variety of model organisms.",1,1U01NS136405-01,RFA-NS-22-049,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,2,13,5,1
10752701,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/hgIaIRGud0CoHeuUwXNzdQ/project-details/10752701#similar-Projects,Peptidoglycan Biogenesis in Escherichia Coli,"A major goal of bacterial cell biology is to understand the mechanisms underlying the assembly and growth of the cell envelope. In addition to addressing a fundamental biological question, studies in this area have significant consequences for human health. The envelope serves as both a major target for antibiotics and, in the case of gram-negative bacteria, a formidable barrier that prevents drugs from reaching their target. Thus, understanding of the mechanisms required for construction of the gram-negative envelope will help identify new vulnerabilities in the process to target for antibiotic development. The peptidoglycan (peptidoglycan) cell wall layer of the envelope is critical for cell shape and integrity. It is composed of long glycans connected by crosslinks between attached peptides to form a net-like structure that surrounds and protects the cytoplasmic membrane from osmotic lysis. In E. coli and many other bacilli, the processes of cell elongation and cell division are carried out by multi-protein cell wall synthetic machines called the Rod system and the divisome, respectively. The Rod system is organized by filaments of the actin-like protein MreB whereas the tubulin-like protein FtsZ governs cell division. Despite years of study, the function of proteins within these machineries have remained surprisingly ill-defined. Until recently, it has even been unclear which enzymes synthesize peptidoglycan within these complexes. Because they were the only factors known to possess peptidoglycan glycan polymerase activity, the class A penicillin-binding proteins (A penicillin-binding proteins) have traditionally been thought to fill this role. However, we changed this view by demonstrating that shape, elongation, division, and sporulation (shape, elongation, division, and sporulation) proteins in the Rod system (RodA) and divisome (FtsW) have peptidoglycan polymerase activity and work in conjunction with peptidoglycan crosslinking enzymes called class B PBPs (B PBPs) to build the cell wall. Our findings have therefore led us to propose a new model for cell wall synthesis where shape, elongation, division, and sporulation-bPBP complexes form the core peptidoglycan synthases of cytoskeletally organized machineries, with RodA-PBP2 and FtsW-PBP3 comprising the Rod system and divisome synthases, respectively. The experiments described in this proposal will build on our recent breakthrough by taking advantage of a newly developed genetic system for the isolation of mutants encoding inactive or hyperactive Rod systems. Several mutants isolated provide a foundation for defining how RodA polymerase activity is regulated within the Rod system and coupled with the crosslinking activity of PBP2. Additional genetic analyses will also be initiated aimed at defining the function of other conserved yet poorly characterized components of the Rod system and their potential role in regulating the activity of the core RodA-PBP2 synthase. Finally, biochemical and genetic studies will be initiated to understand how the related FtsW-PBP3 synthase is regulated within the divisome. Overall, the results will significantly advance our understanding of cell wall biogenesis by multi-protein peptidoglycan synthetic machineries, and the knowledge gained will aid the discovery of new classes of antibacterial agents that target these systems.",5,5R01AI083365-15,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

Once measured, differences in tumor micro-environment composition can be correlated with prognosis, targeted by therapy, and used to test or generate novel therapeutic hypotheses. Our appreciation of tumor micro-environment complexity was significantly advanced with the development of single cell RNA-Sequencing (single cell RNA-Sequencing). But single cell RNA-Sequencing remains expensive, noisy at the level of single cells, and has a slow turn-around time (typically weeks). scRNASeq also typically analyzes only 1000s of cells per sample. As a result, single cell RNA-Sequencing is not practical for deep profiling of large patient or animal cohorts, or for routine hypothesis-testing in cancer research. Faster and more scalable alternatives to single cell RNA-Sequencing are flow cytometry (flow cytometry) and Cytometry by Time of Flight (Cytometry by Time of Flight) but these methods do not resolve the complexity seen in the tumor micro-environment by single cell RNA-Sequencing. Thus, there is an unmet need for rapid, sensitive, highly-multiplexed tumor micro-environment profiling. The focus of this grant is to address this unmet need by advancing a versatile and novel `micro-capsule' technology. Capsules represent an evolution of droplet microfluidics, which is a mature technology for carrying out single cell genomic assays in nanoliter-scale compartments, isolated by oil. Capsules overcome severe technical limitations of water-in-oil droplets: their fragility to handling, and their complete isolation by immiscible oil. By contrast, capsules are resilient, semi-permeable compartments that can be dispersed and processed in any aqueous biological buffer. Prior to this proposal, we optimized capsules to retain cellular mRNA and DNA, while simultaneously enabling rapid exchange of salts, enzymes, primers and probes with the surrounding medium. We have now shown that capsules enable multi-step reactions and serial analyses on single cells and specifically on surface proteins and mRNA molecules. This in turn enables rapid, versatile, highly-multiplexed cytometry. In this R33 we will benchmark and optimize two related capsule-derived methods: the first, ""CapFlow"", implements robust multiplexed mRNA flow cytometry with rapid capsule-based signal amplification. The second, ""CapCycle"", extends CapFlow to quantifying the abundance of ≥50 gene transcripts and cell surface proteins, by replacing flow cytometry with cyclic imaging of immobilized capsules. With these methods, capsules will enable sensitive, versatile, rapid, low-cost, highly-multiplexed phenotyping of tumor heterogeneity. Thus, this proposal fills an important analytical gap, and develops a versatile microfluidic technology with long-term potential to improve biological assays on single biomolecules and cells.",5,5R33CA278392-02,RFA-CA-22-002,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,11,8,2,0

Genetic variants affecting fitness are especially informative for investigating evolution, since natural selection acts exclusively on these variants. By identifying specific variants that influence fitness, we can begin to understand the molecular mechanisms driving the incredible adaptations of all organisms to their environments. We recently developed an approach that allows us to edit genomes with unprecedented efficiency (~100%) and throughput, and precisely measure each edit's effect on fitness. In our initial screen, we measured the fitness effects of 16,000 natural genetic variants differing between two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this pilot experiment, we measured the effects of each variant in isolation, in a single condition. We found that nearly all strong fitness effects were from promoter variants, rather than protein-coding regions, and these were especially enriched at transcription factor binding sites. Here we propose to utilize this powerful system to investigate two concepts of fundamental importance: the role of selection in shaping genetic variation in Aim 1, and gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions in Aim 2. This project will reveal key insights into the evolutionary process that would be unapproachable without our high-throughput precision genome editing technology.",5,5R01GM097171-13,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,11,8,2,0

This involves plasticity that occurs at across different regions of neurons (i.e., subcellular compartmentalization). Our preliminary data revealed compartmentalization of signaling within neurons that encode olfactory memories, and further found that learning drives spatially broad elevations of Ca2+. This suggests that multiple signals are integrated across different spatial scales during learning events to modulate compartmentalized plasticity. Here we will test how compartmentalized plasticity drives the ensembles of changes across multiple spatial scales in the nervous system that leads to coherent action selection. We will test the mechanisms of compartmentalized presynaptic plasticity down to the subcellular level, using the genetically powerful, highly tractable nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster. The Drosophila mushroom body (mushroom body) carries olfactory information from olfactory projection neurons to downstream circuits that mediate fundamental decision-making processes. We will use this system as a testbed to dissect the mechanisms of compartmentalized plasticity at the molecular levels, examine cellular integration and synaptic plasticity, and probe how these processes modulate behavioral action selection via actions on discrete circuits that modulate behavior. Understanding how memories are encoded in the brain and disrupted in brain disorders is a prerequisite to the rational design of treatments for memory impairment. Results of the present studies will provide guideposts for future research into the molecular biology of memory formation across multiple model organisms (including mammals), as the function of key molecules, cellular mechanisms, cellular compartmentalization and synaptic function, circuit motifs, and computational primitives are both conserved across species and crucial across multiple circuits & types of memory.

This proposal will address a new regulatory pathway involved in adipose tissue adipose depot-specific energy expenditure. Understanding how metabolic tissues store and utilize lipids is of central relevance to normal physiology, obesity and diabetes. Excess neutral lipids are stored in lipid droplets (LDs)-dynamic organelles that expand and shrink depending on the metabolic needs of the cell. The molecular mechanisms that link lipid LD dynamics and function to tissue metabolism are incompletely understood. Defining the molecular pathways that govern fuel utilization in tissues is important for understanding systemic homeostasis and the underlying causes of pathological lipid accumulation in the setting of metabolic disease. We have identified Clstn3, an adipose tissueand liver-selective product of the Clstn3 gene, as a key determinant of multilocular LD morphology and function. Clstn3 is an integral ER membrane protein that localizes to ER-LD contact sites via conserved hairpin-like domains. Loss of Clstn3 in mouse brown adipose tissue (brown adipose tissue) increases LD size, reduces triglyceride utilization, and leads to coldinduced hypothermia. Conversely, ectopic expression of Clstn3 in adipocytes is sufficient to reduce LD size and enforce a multilocular LD phenotype. Collectively, these initial discoveries have revealed a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism that maximizes LD surface area and facilitates lipid utilization in thermogenic adipocytes and potentially other cells. The overall goal of this proposal is to further define the mechanisms of Clstn3 action and its contributions to metabolic physiology. Specific Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms by which Clstn3 regulates LD structure and function. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the ability of Clstn3 to modify white adipocyte function. Specific Aim 3 will define the role of Clstn3 in lipid metabolism in other tissues.

Rates of participation in early childhood education programs and public investment in these programs have grown dramatically over the last 30 years, changing the context for understanding the potential long-term program benefits. Whereas existing long-term studies (Perry Preschool, Abecedarian) compared the benefits of early childhood education versus home care, the critical question facing early childhood education programs today is whether improvements in the quality of contemporary early childhood education programming can have incremental long-term benefits. In order to optimize return on investment, long-term studies evaluating costs and benefits of early childhood education program enhancements are needed. The proposed study will examine the long-term outcomes and identify the public service and financial costs affected by the two REDI interventions, enhancements to the Head Start classroom and home visit programming respectively, and estimate their likely return on investment.

In contrast, human pluripotent stem cells derived under traditional conditions represent a more advanced or ""primed"" developmental state that corresponds to the late post-implantation epiblast. My work and that of others has shown that primed human pluripotent stem cells can be reprogrammed into a naïve state marked by globally reduced DNA methylation levels, X chromosome reactivation in female cells, and a broad capacity for differentiation along extraembryonic fates. However, the widespread utilization of naïve human pluripotent stem cells in biomedical research is currently impaired by epigenetic instability during establishment and maintenance of the naïve state. In particular, naïve human pluripotent stem cells generated with currently available methods display irreversible erasure of parent-specific imprinting, retain an epigenetic memory of the inactive X chromosome in female cells, and are not directly responsive to lineage cues for embryonic germ layer induction. My long-term goal is to design rational strategies to derive naïve human pluripotent stem cells that faithfully recapitulate pluripotent cells in vivo and establish a robust cellular platform for modeling human development and disease. Based on our published and preliminary data, I hypothesize that aberrant epigenetic reprogramming during induction of naïve pluripotency is a consequence of inappropriate signal perturbation. I propose to enhance the epigenetic fidelity of naïve human pluripotent stem cells by pursuing three complementary research directions. The first is to elucidate the signaling cascade during early stages of the primed-to-naïve transition using quantitative phosphoproteomics, as a basis for developing strategies to activate the naïve transcriptional circuitry without inadvertently inducing genetic or epigenetic instability. Second, I will employ recently established fluorescent reporter cell lines in combination with chemical and genetic approaches to preserve parent-specific epigenetic information during the establishment of naïve pluripotency and promote random XCI upon exit from naïve human pluripotency. Third, I will enhance the competence of naïve human pluripotent stem cells for rapid induction of all three embryonic germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm) by targeted epigenome editing of cis-regulatory elements that gain accessibility during the transition from naïve to primed pluripotency. The overall aim of this project is to exploit the presently untapped biomedical potential of naïve human pluripotent stem cells and generate a robust in vitro platform to model early human development and disease.",1,1R35GM153439-01,PAR-22-180,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,7,2,0

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ) is the master regulator of adipocyte biology and the target of thiazolidinedione (thiazolidinedione) drugs that uniquely reverse insulin resistance. Clinical use of thiazolidinediones has been hindered by side effects, making it critical to better understand the functions of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. There are two Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ isoforms, and a glaring unanswered question is whether they subserve different functions which could be harnessed to more specifically target insulin resistance. Specific Aim 1 is to elucidate the unique cistromes, interactomes, and physiological functions of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ isoforms γ1 and γ2. Little is known about the two major isoforms of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. We hypothesize that Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ1 and γ2 have isoform-specific functions that differentially contribute to both therapeutic and adverse effects of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ligands. To test this, we generated novel mouse models of isoform-specific deletion, as well as mice with epitope tags knocked into the endogenous isoforms. Preliminary data reveal isoform-specific metabolic phenotypes, as well as differential genomic binding and transcriptomic regulation. The underlying mechanisms will be evaluated by determining isoform-specific interactomes in the basal state and upon thiazolidinedione treatment. Molecular factors that mediate isoform-specific effects will be manipulated to specifically target the metabolic functions of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ1 or γ2. Specific Aim 2 is to determine individual-specific functions of glucocorticoids in humans. The glucocorticoid receptor (glucocorticoid receptor) is another NR that is a major drug target with untoward side effects; glucocorticoids (glucocorticoids) are widely prescribed for inflammatory conditions, but cause obesity, diabetes, and lipid disorders. There is presently no way to predict which patients will suffer from adverse effects of glucocorticoidss, nor which will most benefit from therapy. We hypothesize that single nucleotide polymorphisms function in adipocytes to control glucocorticoid receptor binding and glucocorticoids effects on metabolism and inflammation in a predictable, patient-specific manner. Preliminary data demonstrate individual-specific glucocorticoid receptor binding and glucocorticoids effects on gene expression and metabolism in multiple patient stem cell-derived adipocytes and hepatocytes, which will be related to single nucleotide polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphisms) controlling the binding of glucocorticoid receptor. The mechanisms underlying the function of these single nucleotide polymorphisms will be determined, as will their effects on metabolic functions of the cells as well as predicting adverse metabolic effects of glucocorticoids in patient populations. We also hypothesize that single nucleotide polymorphisms will control individual differences in anti-inflammatory potency due to individual differences in glucocorticoid receptor binding and function that will be tested in stem cell-derived macrophages from multiple patients. Together, our innovative genome-wide and systems approaches will provide fundamental insights into molecular mechanisms underlying tissueand individual-specific effects of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and glucocorticoid receptor, guiding new therapies and predictions of patient-specific therapeutic and adverse responses to drugs.",5,5R01DK049780-29,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,12,2,0,0

Adipogenesis begins with an established cascade of transcription factor (transcription factor) activity that includes collaboration between the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β) and the glucocorticoid receptor (glucocorticoid receptor). A key goal of the present proposal is to determine how CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β and its related paralogs bridge the transcriptional programs in multipotent stem cells and early differentiating pre-adipocytes, with a long-term objective of understanding a comprehensive transcription factor network promoting adipose tissue development, growth and function. Specific Aim 1 comprehensively identifies the components of active enhancers during human adipogenesis. We will perform a state-of-the-art genomic/proteomic approach to determine the chromatin-associated proteins promoting adipocyte differentiation. Specific Aim 2 elucidates the mechanistic actions of networked transcription factors and co-regulators that control human adipogenesis and adipocyte function. Novel adipogenic roles for protein candidates identified in Aims 1 will be examined by mutational analysis and genome-wide approaches. As a whole, we will generate and integrate unique, orthogonal cistromic and enhancer proteomic datasets to reveal fundamental molecular mechanisms for transcriptional regulators in native chromatin. This will elucidate how CEBP proteins and glucocorticoid receptor perform unique biological functions, and address the more general question of how transcription factors recognize, access and act at their genomic-binding sites to control tissue-specific gene expression. Specific Aim 3 comprehensively identifies the components of active enhancers in adipose tissue. We hypothesize that comparison of the enhancer proteomes from visceral and subcutaneous white adipose tissues and from brown adipose tissue will reveal fundamental mechanisms controlling depot-specific gene expression and uncover the set of transcriptional regulators controlling lipid metabolism in vivo. Our focus on the development and function of adipose tissue is warranted given its importance in health and disease. Indeed, adipose tissue normally benefits health, yet in excess as in obesity, it becomes a strong risk for metabolic diseases including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and heart disease.

Thus, identifying the tumor microenvironment factors and mechanisms by which the tumor microenvironment regulates drug response in pancreatic adenocarcinomas is critical to being able to effectively treat this disease. Towards the goal of identifying tumor microenvironment factors regulating pancreatic adenocarcinomas biology, we have taken the strategy of measuring physiological parameters in the pancreatic adenocarcinomas tumor microenvironment and recreating these conditions ex vivo to study in mechanistic detail how pancreatic adenocarcinomas cells are impacted by tumor microenvironment physiology. As part of this approach, we recently developed techniques to isolate interstitial fluid (the local perfusate) from pancreatic adenocarcinomas tumors and quantitative metabolite profiling techniques to measure availability of ~150 major nutrients in the pancreatic adenocarcinomas tumor microenvironment. This provided us with the first quantitative atlas of nutrient availability in pancreatic adenocarcinomas and we found that local nutrient abundance in these tumors was strikingly different than in the bulk circulation or healthy tissues. To study how abnormal access to nutrients in the tumor microenvironment could impact pancreatic adenocarcinomas cells, we developed a novel cell culture model in which pancreatic adenocarcinomas cells are cultured with the precise levels of ~120 major vitamins and nutrients they encounter in the native tumor microenvironment. Using this model, we found that pancreatic adenocarcinomas cells exposed to tumor microenvironment nutrition exhibit resistance to a wide array of clinically used chemotherapies, identifying abnormal tumor nutrient availability as a critical tumor microenvironment factor mediating chemoresistance in this disease. Further analysis of tumor microenvironment nutrientinduced chemoresistant phenotype indicated that:  increased availability of the amino acid glycine in the tumor microenvironment causes pancreatic adenocarcinomas cells to become highly chemoresistance and  tumor microenvironment glycine does not endow pancreatic adenocarcinomas cells with the ability to evade action of chemotherapies, but rather the ability to tolerate damage induced by therapeutic challenges. Based on these preliminary studies, we developed the hypothesis that tumor microenvironment glycine impairs the ability of pancreatic adenocarcinomas cells to undergo cell death in response to chemotherapeutic insult, thus enabling pancreatic adenocarcinomas cells to tolerate chemotherapeutic treatment. In this proposal, we will determine:  the metabolic basis for how glycine accumulates in the pancreatic adenocarcinomas tumor microenvironment and if targeting tumor microenvironment glycine availability can sensitize pancreatic adenocarcinomas tumors to chemotherapy and  the mechanism by which pancreatic adenocarcinomas cells gain tolerance to chemotherapeutic stress and if targeting these tolerance mechanisms can synergize with chemotherapy. Therapy resistance is a major contributor to the poor prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinomas patients. Our work addresses this key therapeutic challenge in a disease with much unmet clinical need and could identify novel therapeutic options for pancreatic adenocarcinomas patients.",1,1R01CA276461-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

However, for patients who decline HIV/HCV screening, there is no evidence-based intervention to persuade them to be tested. In response to the deficit of an intervention to increase ED HIV/HCV screening acceptance, we recently completed an R34 project during which we developed a persuasive health communication intervention (persuasive health communication intervention) with stakeholder assistance (ED patients, HIV/HCV counselors, and ED medical staff). In two pilot studies, we examined the efficacy of the persuasive health communication intervention among adult ED patients who initially declined HIV/HCV screening. In one pilot study, adult ED patients assigned to watch a control condition video were more likely to agree to be tested than those who received the persuasive health communication intervention in-person from an HIV/HCV counselor (n=56, 27% vs. 10%; ∆17%, ∆95% CI: 6-32%). However, in a separate pilot study, adult ED patients randomly assigned to watch a video of a physician delivering the PCHI to an ED patient were more likely to agree to be tested than those who watched the control condition video (n=60, 29% vs. 11%; ∆18%, ∆95% CI: 7-35%). These results suggest that the persuasive health communication intervention video might increase HIV/HCV screening acceptance more than a persuasive health communication intervention delivered in-person by an HIV/HCV counselor. If these results are confirmed in a larger study, the persuasive health communication intervention video could enable wider usage of the persuasive health communication intervention and facilitate greater acceptance of ED HIV/HCV screening. Unfortunately, in our R34 project we did not develop nor evaluate the persuasive health communication intervention among current and former people who inject drugs (people who inject drugs). As such, the current persuasive health communication intervention might be inadequate in persuading current/former people who inject drugs to be tested, and thus needs modification with the help of current/former people who inject drugs to be effective for these very high HIV/HCV-risk patients. In this R01 project, we first will modify the persuasive health communication intervention with input from current/former people who inject drugs. Next, we will conduct a randomized, controlled trial (randomized, controlled trial) to compare the persuasive health communication intervention's efficacy when delivered by a video vs. an HIV/HCV counselor. Adult ED patients who declined HIV/HCV screening will be stratified by IDU history:  current/former people who inject drugs or  never/non-people who inject drugs. Within each of these strata, we will randomly assign participants to a persuasive health communication intervention delivered by  video  HIV/HCV counselor. Current/former people who inject drugs will receive the persuasive health communication intervention modified for people who inject drugs, whereas never/non-people who inject drugs will receive the non-modified, original persuasive health communication intervention version. For Aim 1, we will determine which delivery form of the persuasive health communication intervention (video or HIV/HCV counselor) results in more ED patients accepting HIV/HCV screening, independent of their history of IDU. For Aim 2, we will determine which delivery form of the persuasive health communication intervention results in more ED patients accepting HIV/HCV screening within each IDU history cohort (current/former people who inject drugs, never/non-people who inject drugs), and if testing acceptance is similar across IDU history cohorts. For Aim 3, we will further compare the two persuasive health communication intervention delivery forms through a health economics assessment, both independent of IDU history and within each IDU history cohort.",5,5R01DA055533-03,PA-18-722,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,6,5,3,2

In particular, single-cell RNA-sequencing (single-cell RNA-sequencing) has revealed that each glioblastoma is a mixture of different types of tumor cells, each with different biological properties, or cell states. Consequently, it may be necessary to treat each patient with personalized drug combinations. Although single-cell RNA-sequencing has enabled us to understand the complexity of glioblastoma, its clinical potential is largely untapped. This is partly because it is difficult to physically isolate and study the cell types discovered using single-cell RNA-sequencing. In previous work, we showed that cell surface markers identified through single-cell RNA-sequencing can be used to purify tumor subpopulations using flow sorting. Building on this, we propose a novel approach to isolating glioblastoma cell populations, studying their therapeutic vulnerabilities, and identifying personalized drug combinations that target multiple cell populations simultaneously. Our approach is based on Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing), an extension of single-cell RNA-sequencing that will enable us to efficiently define tumor cell populations and isolate them using flow sorting. We will test the drug sensitivities of each cell population, and then identify combinations of drugs that more effectively eradicate the tumor. This approach will be developed through two Specific Aims:  We will isolate and characterize glioblastoma subpopulations using Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing and flow sorting. Using our preliminary single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we identified a panel of candidate cell-surface markers for known glioblastoma subpopulations. Using oligo-conjugated antibodies to these putative markers, we will perform Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing in primary tumors and matched cell lines to determine which markers cleanly distinguish among tumor cell populations. Using the most promising markers, we will test and optimize our ability to separate glioblastoma samples into distinct subpopulations using flow sorting. In doing so, we will test the hypothesis that there exist stable glioblastoma cell states that persist after flow sorting.  We will perform drug-screening on flow-sorted glioblastoma subpopulations to identify personalized drug combinations. To this end, we will isolate several subpopulations from each of five cell lines using flow sorting, then test each subpopulation (as well as the flow-through and the unsorted cell lines) for sensitivity to each of 960 FDA-approved drugs including temozolomide (current standard of care), and specific combinations thereof. The resulting drug sensitivity matrix will be analyzed using clustering and machine learning techniques to identify drugs that, when used in combination, will target multiple glioblastoma subpopulations and achieve greater efficacy than a single drug alone. If this approach is promising in pilot experiments, we ultimately hope to expand and adapt it to the clinic, so that we can readily identify drug combinations for any individual's tumor.",1,1R21CA286215-01,PAR-22-216,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Although the field has focused on prolonging the short-duration (Although the field has focused on prolonging the short-duration) response of each dose using more persistent drug preparations and delivery methods, these pharmacological approaches have limited and short-term benefits. Wearing-off is driven by a decline in the duration of benefit of each dose, due to the decay of the long-duration response (long-duration response) that lowers the trough level performance. We recently showed the importance of task-specific learning and the striatopallidal pathway in long-duration response induction and decay. Interestingly, our preliminary data suggest that repeated optogenetic stimulations of globus pallidus externa (globus pallidus externa) parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons - part of the striatopallidal pathway - induced long-term rescue: mice showed improved locomotion when reintroduced to the same open-field environment ≥24 h after the final stimulation session. This resembled long-duration response induced by repeated L-DOPA treatments. However, while long-duration response induced by L-DOPA was selective to the induction context, long-duration response induced by stimulation of globus pallidus externa PV+ neurons transferred to a new context. Thus, repeated stimulation of globus pallidus externa PV+ neurons conferred long-term motoric benefits but may also reduce discrimination learning. This project aims to uncover the mechanisms underlying these properties of long-duration response. globus pallidus externa PV+ neurons consist of two subpopulations: those that project to substantia nigra vs. to parafasicular thalamus. We will establish how the activities of these two globus pallidus externa subpopulations are altered during parkinsonian locomotion impairment and during different phases of long-duration response, both for long-duration response induced by L-DOPA and by globus pallidus externa PV+ neuronal stimulation. We will also examine whether perturbing these two globus pallidus externa subpopulations results in dissociable effects on long-lasting locomotion rescue vs. its context selectivity. This project will advance our knowledge in the role of the striatopallidal pathway in mediating long-duration response, and elucidate both therapeutic utility and potential side effects of globus pallidus externa deep brain stimulation.",1,1R21NS137136-01A1,PA-21-219,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

This remarkable biological potential, known as pluripotency, is associated with a complex transcription network, an ultrafast cell division cycle that lacks typical checkpoints, and an atypical response to activation of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) pathway. While a lot of progress has been made in characterizing the pluripotency transcription network, less is known about the cell division cycle of embryonic stem cells and its molecular links to the pluripotency transcription network. In addition, a critical yet poorly understood process is how embryonic stem cells use the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase pathway to control their self-renewal and differentiation. Our driving hypothesis is that the cell division cycle and pluripotency transcription network are linked through a bidirectional molecular feedback loop that is regulated by the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase activity. To test our hypothesis, we will: I. Characterize novel regulators of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase pathway identified in our CRISPR screen in embryonic stem cells II. Determine functional substrate network of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase kinases, Mek and Erk, in embryonic stem cells using chemical-genetic kinase engineering and quantitative phosphoproteomics. III. Determine mechanisms of pluripotency maintenance by the G1 cell cycle kinase (Cdk2) using direct labeling of the substrates by chemical-genetic engineering of Cdk2.

This proposal will address a new regulatory pathway involved in adipocyte nutrient sensing, adipose tissue physiology, and adipose depot-specific energy expenditure. The proposed studies are focused on understanding how dynamic regulation adipocyte membrane composition contributes to the control of whole-body metabolic homeostasis in living animals. Preliminary data implicates the phospholipid remodeling enzyme Lpcat3 as novel mechanistic link between dietary fatty acid intake, adipose tissue homeostasis, and susceptibility to obesity. This proposal builds upon our preliminary discoveries to address important questions regarding the relationship of membrane lipid composition to adipose tissue function and systemic physiology and energy balance. We have previously shown that the enzyme Lpcat3 is uniquely required for the incorporation of the 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids. Our preliminary data reveal that adipose Lpcat3 expression is induced in the setting of cold exposure or diet-induced obesity. Moreover, initial characterization of mice lacking Lpcat3 selectively in adipose tissues has revealed two distinct phenotypes: one traced to white adipose tissue (white adipose tissue) and one traced to brown adipose tissue (brown adipose tissue). Adipose Lpcat3 KO mice fed a high-fat diet develop a lipodystrophic phenotype are unable to appropriately expand their white adipose tissue, leading to ectopic hepatic lipid accumulation and the compensatory upregulation of fatty acid oxidation in white adipose tissue. At the same time, brown adipose tissue Lpcat3 KO mice show an abnormal response to cold challenge, characterized by marked ER stress. A striking commonality between these white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue KO models is the compensatory production of FGF21 in an apparent effort to maintain energy homeostasis. We hypothesize that the fine tuning of adipose tissue membrane composition by Lpcat3 is a critical adaptive response to cold and dietary challenge that permits optimal lipid storage and catabolic function in a range of environments. We will address these hypotheses with the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1 is to elucidate the role of membrane phospholipid remodeling in nutrient sensing and healthy adipose tissue expansion. Specific Aim 2 is to determine the role of phospholipid remodeling in brown adipose tissue function and response to thermal stress.",5,5R01DK129276-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,12,2,0,0

The cerebral cortex is a structure where model systems, such as mouse or rat, may not capture the complexity of architecture and function relevant for understanding human development and disease. This proposal aims to address the gap in our understanding of human cortical development through the study of primary tissue complemented by human stem cell-derived in vitro model systems, using ""cerebral organoids"". Understanding human-specific aspects of brain development is not only critically important for understanding the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia and ultimately developing therapies, but will also benefit our understanding of human cortical evolution, the diversity and lineage of neural cell types, and the mechanisms of cortical expansion - it will help define what makes us unique. The developing human brain contains an enlarged proliferative region, the outer subventricular zone (outer subventricular zone) that is not present in rodents. This study will target two recently discovered neural progenitor cell types found in the outer subventricular zone, outer radial glia (outer radial glia) and intermediate progenitor (intermediate progenitor) cells. These cell types are particularly important as they underlie the huge developmental and evolutionary expansion of the human brain. This proposal seeks to illuminate the complexity of human cortical development in terms of the genomic, cellular, and behavioral features of its constituent outer radial glia and intermediate progenitor neural progenitor cells and their progeny through the key stages of neurogenesis. We plan to discover lineage trajectories that define progenitor-progeny relationships and determine the cellular fates of clonal descendants. We will use novel outer radial glia and intermediate progenitorC markers to enrich progenitor cell populations for analysis, explore the intracellular signaling networks that regulate intermediate progenitor cell expansion, investigate the role of distinct neurogenic niches in creating neuronal diversity, and examine neuron to progenitor signaling pathways that may regulate intermediate progenitorC neurogenesis. Additionally, we will explore the role of outer radial glias and intermediate progenitorCs in lissencephaly and related neurodevelopmental diseases, and pursue an intriguing relationship between outer radial glia cells and invasive glioblastoma. These ambitious goals are attainable due to recent technological advances, including improvements in single cell genomics, bioinformatics, real time imaging of primary tissue samples, and in vitro models of human cortical development.

The many years of work with this outbred model of male Long Evans have established that a subpopulation at older ages exhibit impaired performance while other rats in the aged cohort maintain preserved performance on a par with young adults. These well-characterized individual differences have been used successfully to examine neurobiological variations in the medial temporal lobe that are closely coupled to cognitive outcomes. Core B under this application will add female Long Evans rats to the resource for studies of individual differences with sex considered as a biological variable in accordance with NIH guidelines.

In this proposal, we will explore the role of reprogramming of tumor microenvironment (tumor microenvironment) by p38 MAPK inhibition to promote a robust dendritic cell (DC)-driving anti-ALR immunity to prevent acquired resistance in adoptive cell therapy. In our in vivo preliminary studies, co-treatment with CAR T cells and Ralimetinib (a potent and selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK developed for cancer patients) confers immunogenic DC signature characteristics within tumor microenvironment. Strikingly, CAR T cell+Ralimetinib-treatment eradicated established tumors and resulted in long-term tumor-free survival by triggering a robust host anti-ALR immunity, whereas CAR T cell adoptive cell therapy alone recapitulated the clinical scenario of cancer relapse mediated by ALRs. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that p38 MAPK is a critical molecular switch that controls DC differentiation, where p38 inhibition promotes an immunogenic DC transcriptional program and induces potent anti-ALR immunity to prevent the acquired resistance in T cell therapy. Aim 1 will determine the role of NFκB/Stat5 signaling by repression of PPARγ in the molecular mechanisms of Ralimetinib-mediated DC enrichment.

Both overand under-diagnosis of disorders have serious consequences, including long-term reading difficulty and potential high school dropout. This highlights a critical need for valid, accurate diagnostic protocols to reliably identify language and reading disorders among young bilingual learners. Consequently, the long-term goal of the proposed research is to establish practical, accurate diagnostic protocols for identifying language and reading disorders among bilingual learners early in children's development. Representing the next step toward this goal, the overall objective of this project is to generate assessment protocols that have evidence of reliability and validity for identifying language and/or reading disorders among Spanish-English bilingual learners in kindergarten to 2nd grade. Through annual assessments of children's decoding and linguistic comprehension skills in Spanish and English, we will integrate information from static bilingual assessment, learning-based dynamic assessment, and parent/teacher report to identify accurate, reliable markers of language and reading disorders. Three specific aims will be addressed. First, we will develop an empirically derived protocol to identify word reading difficulty (WRD; also, dyslexia) among Spanish-English bilingual children across kindergarten through second grade. Second, we will develop an empirically derived protocol to identify developmental language disorder (developmental language disorder) among Spanish-English bilingual children across kindergarten through second grade. Third, we will identify how heterogeneity in reading ability influences links between word reading, oral language, and reading comprehension, measured continuously. This work is significant because it will substantially advance diagnostic practice for identifying language and word reading disorders among bilingual learners, contributing to accurate diagnoses to prevent students from falling behind their peers during the early elementary years. Early identification of bilingual students likely to have difficulty in school allows educators to allocate specialized resources and individualized instruction to maximize gains for those students.

For motion perception the cell types, circuits and synaptic mechanisms that mediate selectivity to the direction of moving stimuli have been intensively studied in the non-primate mammal for decades and over a dozen distinct direction selective pathways are recognized in the mouse retina together with growing evidence for similarly diverse underlying neural mechanisms. The great complexity of the visual pathways found in the mouse is mirrored in the primate, yet surprisingly the abundant direction selective ganglion cells have not been previously identified. The broad long-term objective of this new research program is to elucidate for the first time the cell types, circuits, synaptic organization and underlying cellular mechanisms for direction selectivity in the macaque monkey retina, as an ideal model for human visual processing centered around the fovea. Our proposed research plan arises from a series of discoveries that opens a door to the first detailed study of both the visual physiology and synaptic organization of direction selective circuitry in the macaque retina. In preliminary studies we have identified the primate ON-OFF direction selective ganglion cell as the recursive bistratified type and have developed new methods that permit systematic targeting of this cell type for analysis. The synaptic physiology and directional tuning of this ganglion cell type are the focus of Aim 1 where we test the hypothesis that directional selectivity in the primate is radially aligned with respect to the fovea. Second, we have developed reliable methods for targeting the starburst amacrine cell type, the key retinal interneuron in the direction selective circuit, for both physiological analysis and connectomic circuit reconstruction for the first time. Preliminary data reveal novel features of starburst receptive field structure, directional tuning and connectivity providing the focus for Aim 2 where we test new hypotheses for the cellular origins of direction selectivity and its synaptic transfer to ganglion cells. Finally, we have discovered direction selectivity in the poly-axonal spiking A1 amacrine cell type and evidence for a functional link to ON-OFF direction selective ganglion cells. The focus of Aim 3 therefore is to test the hypotheses that the A1 cells unique axonal component provides synaptic input to both starburst and ON-OFF direction selective ganglion cells, and determine the role of the A1 cells unique dendro-axonal structure in direction selectivity. In sum the broad aim is to characterize the directional tuning properties of these three cell types, and to use connectomics for the first time to determine the underlying synaptic interactions that create direction selectivity in the primate retina. Outcomes will thus have a specific impact on understanding of mechanisms motion processing in human vision and more broadly on growing applications of the primate model for the development of tools and methods for vision restoration.",5,5R01EY032045-04,PA-19-056,NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE,0,13,5,1

In persons with normal alcohol metabolism, differences in level of response to an acute intoxicating dose of alcohol result mainly from differences in acute tolerance to alcohol. Tolerance has a major influence on alcohol consumption; tolerance to alcohol's rewarding effects encourages more drinking to achieve a desired effect, whereas tolerance to alcohol's aversive properties reduces a disincentive to drink. This proposal is based on recent findings that inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 (phosphodiesterase 4) reduce alcohol drinking in rodents. In our work with the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor apremilast, we were struck by the relationship between its ability to reduce both alcohol tolerance and ethanol consumption. Inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 4 reduce metabolism of cAMP which leads to activation of protein kinase A (protein kinase A). Alcohol has prominent effects on GABAA receptors, and it has been known for many years that protein kinase A alters the function of GABAA receptors through phosphorylation of β1 and β3 receptor subunits. Our preliminary experiments led us to our overall hypothesis that phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition reduces alcohol tolerance and alcohol consumption by increasing GABAA receptor function in the brain through protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of GABAA receptor β3 subunits, with protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of β1 subunits contributing a minor opposite effect. Studies are planned to test this hypothesis by determining whether apremilast increases protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of b3 and β1 subunits in hippocampal slices from wild type mice. Studies will examine the role of protein kinase A phosphorylation on alcohol-related behaviors using b3S408A/S409A and b1-S409A knock-in mice, which lack the protein kinase A phosphorylation sites of interest. We will examine the role of specific brain phosphodiesterase 4 isozymes in these alcohol-related behaviors using phosphodiesterase 4 isozymeselective inhibitors and knockout mice. We will also determine whether b3 and β1 subunits associate with specific phosphodiesterase 4 isoforms by isolating GABAA receptor complexes using Blue Native PAGE and analyzing them with mass spectrometry (LS-MS/MS). Finally, we will test the hypothesis that a b1-selective, positive allosteric modulator (positive allosteric modulator) alone or in combination with apremilast will reduce alcohol tolerance and alcohol consumption. These experiments will characterize a new series of 10 novel compounds targeting b1-containing GABAA receptors using receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes, to identify a b1-selective positive allosteric modulator with properties suitable for testing in mice.",5,5R01AA028807-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM,0,1,8,1

Recently, we demonstrated that primary HIV-1 Envs, when expressed by simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (simian-human immunodeficiency viruses) in rhesus macaques (rhesus macaques), elicited patterns of Env-antibody coevolution strikingly similar to humans infected by homologous virus strains, leading to neutralization breadth. These similarities in Env-antibody coevolution in humans and rhesus included conserved immunogenetic, structural and chemical solutions to epitope recognition and precise Env amino acid substitutions, insertions and deletions leading to virus persistence. The structure of one rhesus bNAb, capable of neutralizing 49% of a 208-strain panel, revealed a V2-apex mode of recognition like that of human broadly neutralizing antibodies PGT145 and PCT64-35M. Another rhesus antibody bound the CD4-binding site of HIV-1 Env by CD4 mimicry mirroring human broadly neutralizing antibodies 8ANC131, CH235 and VRC01. Based on these observations supporting the relevance of the rhesus model to bNAb induction in humans, we propose here a novel ""reverse vaccinology"" strategy in SHIV infected rhesus macaques as a ""molecular guide"" to inform and accelerate HIV-1 vaccine design in humans. Specific aims are: (i) To isolate bNAb mAbs targeting CD4bs, fusion peptide, V3 glycan and V2 apex epitopes from a subset of 150 SHIV infected rhesus macaques and to characterize their breadth, potency, immunogenetics, target epitopes and structural solutions to epitope recognition. (ii) To characterize molecular patterns of Env-Ab coevolution from rhesus germline B cell unmutated common ancestors (unmutated common ancestors) to mature broadly neutralizing antibodies and to identify key Env intermediates, or ""immunotypes,"" that are responsible for driving bNAb lineage affinity maturation to breadth. (iii) To design, construct and characterize novel SOSIP Env trimers that mimic key Env ""immunotypes"" and demonstrate that they bind preferentially to bNAb unmutated common ancestors and intermediate stage Abs. (iv) To conduct a proofof-concept preclinical vaccine trial in 24 rhesus macaques to test the hypothesis that reverse-engineered, B lineage-designed SOSIP Env trimers can prime, boost and affinity mature bNAb responses in rhesus macaques to an extent that is superior to conventional SOSIP Env immunogens and comparable to SOSIP-SHIV or SHIV-only immunizations.",5,5R01AI160607-04,PAR-20-158,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

Since most HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies have come from humans infected by HIV-1, we hypothesized that one means to elicit bNabs in primates might be by infecting rhesus macaques (rhesus macaques) with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (simian-human immunodeficiency virus) strains that bear primary or transmitted/founder HIV-1 Envs, including those that induced broadly neutralizing antibodies in humans. simian-human immunodeficiency virus infected rhesus macaques could then be employed to assess the potential of different HIV-1 Envs to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies and to characterize the coevolutionary pathways of bNAb lineages and cognate Envs that elicited them, thereby serving as a ""molecular guide"" for rational vaccine design. Recent innovations in simian-human immunodeficiency virus design by our lab have made this experimental strategy testable. In this renewal application, we show that 24 of 150, or 16%, of rhesus macaques infected by simian-human immunodeficiency viruss bearing different primary HIV-1 Envs developed broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting V3 glycan, V2 apex, CD4bs or fusion peptide epitopes. Nine of these animals developed V3 glycan broadly neutralizing antibodies. From this extensive dataset, we identified HIV-1 CH848 and BG505.N332 Envs as immunogens that most consistently elicited V3 glycan broadly neutralizing antibodies in rhesus macaques. We further showed that by reducing the length of V1 and the number of potential N-linked glycans in V1 (designated CH848.dV1 and BG505.N332.dV1), we could enhance the frequency and speed of induction of V3 glycan broadly neutralizing antibodies in simian-human immunodeficiency virus infected rhesus macaques. Based on these findings, we propose in this project to test the hypothesis that infection of rhesus macaques by simian-human immunodeficiency virus.CH848.dV1 or simian-human immunodeficiency virus.BG505.N332.dV1 will selectively prime V3 glycan bNAb lineage B cell precursors, and through a process of Env-Ab coevolution, mature these responses to achieve neutralization breadth. Moreover, by identifying evolved Env intermediates that select for V3 glycan bNAb affinity maturation, we can design lineage-based Env immunogens that, when constructed as SOSIP Env trimers and used to immunize outbred rhesus macaques, will elicit V3 glycan broadly neutralizing antibodies that are protective against heterologous virus challenge. Specific Aims are: (i) to decipher molecular pathways of Env-Ab coevolution in simian-human immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus macaques that lead to the development of V3 glycan broadly neutralizing antibodies, including the identification of inferred germline bNAb precursors, bNAb lineage intermediates and evolved Env intermediates that select for affinity maturation and neutralization breadth; (ii) to evaluate the ability of nanoparticle-delivered, germline-targeted CH848.dV1 and BG505.N332.dV1 SOSIP Env trimers to prime V3 glycan bNAb lineage precursors and for subsequent homologous simian-human immunodeficiency virus infection to select for affinity maturation and neutralization breadth; and (iii) to conduct a statistically-powered, proof-of-concept vaccine trial in rhesus macaques testing the hypothesis that germline-targeted, B lineage-designed SOSIP Env trimers can prime, boost and affinity mature V3 glycan bNAb responses to an extent that is superior to conventional SOSIP Env immunogens and that protects rhesus macaques from heterologous virus challenge.",5,5P01AI131251-08,PAR-21-024,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

Arguably, the most important in vivo system, which also happens to be the most dynamic, is development itself, wherein the nucleome both shapes and is shaped by the initial emergence of the myriad mammalian cell types. While these in vivo dynamics are presently poorly documented and understood, recently emerged technologies offer a path forward. Here we propose to establish the University of Washington 4-Dimensional Genomic Nuclear Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME Center), which will address these massive gaps in our understanding by generating systematic datasets on nuclear morphology and associated molecular measurements in mammalian tissues and cell types.

In fact, more retinal ganglion cell (retinal ganglion cell) types may project to the superior colliculus than any other retinal target including the lateral geniculate nucleus (lateral geniculate nucleus). Understanding retinal input to superior colliculus is important because superior colliculus plays a major role in a range of attentional and decision-making processes in both rodents and primates - two major model systems used in biomedical research supported by the National Institutes of Health. However, the functional diversity of retinal input to superior colliculus, and ultimately how it impacts superior colliculus signaling, remains poorly understood in mammals. This gap is particularly pronounced in primates. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the diversity of cell types and the visual signals they transmit from the retina to superior colliculus in rats and rhesus monkeys. The rationale for this proposal is that to understand the role of superior colliculus in visually guided behaviors, we must determine how retinal signals converge and are processed in superior colliculus. The first step toward achieving this goal is to determine which retinal ganglion cell types project to superior colliculus and what visual signals they carry. Performing these experiments in both rodents and macaques is critical not just for understanding which specific visual pathways are conserved (or diverge) from rodent to the primate brain, but also what evolutionary advantages such specializations endow to each species. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will use and optimize viral methods for retrogradely infecting retinal ganglion cells that project directly to superior colliculus in rats. We will determine the morphological diversity of these retinal ganglion cells. We will also determine their receptive fields and other visual response properties, ex vivo, using large-scale multi-electrode arrays. The outcome will be a complete catalog of the morphological and functional types of retinal ganglion cells that project to superior colliculus in the rat brain. In Aim 2, we will use the most effective viral approaches from Aim 1 to dissect the diversity of retinal ganglion cell types that project to superior colliculus in monkeys. As with rats, we will determine the morphological diversity of these retinal ganglion cells in macaques and determine their receptive fields and other visual response properties using large-scale, high throughput electrophysiology. In Aim 3, we will determine the overlap of retinal ganglion cell projections to superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus, separately for rats and primates. Retrograde viruses injected into superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus will carry genes for different fluorescent proteins that will allow us to determine the types and functions of retinal ganglion cells that project to one versus both brain areas. The overall outcome of this project will be a functional and morphological catalog of retinal ganglion cells that project to superior colliculus in rats and primates, allowing for detailed cross-species comparison of this key visual circuit. This comparison is important given how much research is dedicated to the rodent visual system with the ultimate aim of understanding the human visual system. The data will be critical for designing next-stage studies that will measure and manipulate the functions of specific populations of superior colliculus-projecting retinal ganglion cells in order to determine their contributions to visual processing and behavior and their potential impairments in ADHD and other attentional and visuomotor disorders.",5,5R01EY034004-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE,0,1,5,1

It is thought that threedimensional (3D) chromatin organization is driven by transcriptional regulators, but fundamental mechanisms of this regulation as it relates to disease-relevant human cells have not been well explored. We propose to elucidate the temporally dynamic 3D nucleome (4DN) that underlies human cardiac differentiation, its molecular underpinnings, and the impact of mutations that underly defective 4DN organization in human congenital heart disease (congenital heart disease). congenital heart diseases are the most common birth defect and arise from abnormal heart development. The genetic basis of congenital heart disease is largely mutations in genes encoding chromatin modifiers (e.g. WDR5, KMT2D) and transcription factors (TFs, e.g. TBX5, GATA4), many of which also cause adult-onset arrhythmias. The impact of congenital heart disease mutations on the 4DN has not been explored. We hypothesize that 3D genome folding is highly regulated during cardiac differentiation and is impacted by disease-causing mutations in transcriptional regulators and non-coding elements. We will use iPS cell models and machine learning to elucidate dynamic 3D chromatin organization in human cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells during normal and diseased cardiac differentiation. We propose 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Establish a kilobase-scale 4D map of genome folding in human cardiomyocytes (cardiomyocytes) and endothelial cell (endothelial cell) differentiation. We will use directed differentiation of human iPS cells towards the two major cell types of the developing heart: cardiomyocytess and endothelial cells, and using microC across a fine time course of differentiation we will define at kilobase scale the 3D organization of the genome, capturing the states of developmental intermediates and the final differentiated cells. This aim will generate an essential integrated 4DN template for discovery in cardiac differentiation. In Aim 2: we will Determine the regulatory and disease-related basis for cardiac 3D chromatin organization. We will perform microC in iPS cell lines with congenital heart disease-associated mutations in transcriptional regulators, differentiated into cardiomyocytess and endothelial cells. These findings will establish the degree to which congenital heart disease is caused by abnormal genome folding and chromatin states, with important relevance to other human cardiovascular diseases. Finally, Aim 3 will address High-throughput screening of millions of congenital heart disease and synthetic noncoding mutations with a deep-learning model of dynamic genome folding. We will build a deep-learning model predicting 3D chromatin contact frequencies across cardiac differentiation at kilobase-resolution. By introducing thousands of congenital heart disease patient deletions and other non-coding mutations in silico, we will prioritize variants likely to interact with transcriptional regulators to cause disease through disrupted genome folding.

We observe that some humans who died with pneumonia have abundant fibrinolytics in their airspaces while others show little or none, correlating with neutrophils and necrosis. Similarly, some mouse models of pneumonia result in lungs with abundant airspace fibrinolytics, while others do not; airspace fibrinolytics associates with both neutrophils and necrosis in these models as well. While fibrinolytics in the airspaces is a recognized pathological feature of pneumonia, this heterogeneity is not. Because fibrinolytics can be proinflammatory and neutrophils can enhance fibrinolytics accumulation, we propose the central hypothesis that fibrinolytics and neutrophils in the airspaces form a positive feedback loop that causes damage in a subset of pneumonias. We will test this by pursuing three independent but mutually informative specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine whether fibrinolytics in the airspaces drives neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation and adverse outcomes, during high-fibrinolytics pneumonia. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to interrupt key endogenous drivers or inhibitors of fibrinolytics accumulation (tissue factor, thrombin, or plasmin), we will test whether loss or gain of fibrinolytics decreases or increases, respectively, neutrophils and adverse outcomes like necrosis and lung injury during the high-fibrinolytics but not low-fibrinolytics type of pneumonia in mice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether neutrophils amplify fibrinolytics accumulation in the airspaces, during high-fibrinolytics pneumonia. We will use genetargeted mice to test whether CD11b and neutrophil elastase are each essential for airspace fibrinolytics accumulation during the high-fibrinolytics but not low-fibrinolytics sub-phenotype of pneumonia. We will also test whether pharmacologically reducing fibrinolytics or elastase activity when pneumonia is already underway can sever the proposed positive feedback loop and improve outcomes during the high-fibrinolytics pneumonia in mice. In Aim 3, we will determine whether high-fibrinolytics pneumonias involve distinctive lung transcriptomes that include a pro-fibrinolytics signature in airspace cells, and neutrophils. We will profile lung transcriptomes of humans who died with high-fibrinolytics vs. low-fibrinolytics pneumonia, to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways. In mouse models, we will compare lung transcriptomes over the time-course of lethal highand low-fibrinolytics pneumonias, to reveal dynamics of changes as well as consistencies or differences between the human subjects and mouse models. From mouse lungs, airspace cells, and neutrophils (alveolar macrophages, epithelial cells, and neutrophils, and neutrophils) will be sorted from highand low-fibrinolytics pneumonias to identify cell-specific transcriptome differences between these pneumonia sub-phenotypes. The proposed studies will help elucidate the mechanisms and significance of high fibrinolytics accumulation in the airspaces of infected lungs. Results will be informative for whether and which subsets of pneumonia patients may respond favorably to host-directed therapies targeting fibrinolytics (like anticoagulants and fibrinolyticsolytics) and/or neutrophils (like CD11b blockade or elastase inhibitors).",1,1R01HL171499-01,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",3,4,1,3

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (Heparan sulfate proteoglycans) are glycoproteins that promote oligomerization of amyloidβ and prions in vitro and slow the clearance of amyloid-β in the brain of an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans interact with misfolded proteins through their HS chains and promote their internalization in immortalized neural cells. This protein aggregate uptake is profoundly impacted by the HS length and level of sulfation which, importantly, broadly differ between cell types. We and others have used highly sulfated HS-like glycopolymers to test the crucial role of HS in the interaction and in vitro replication of prions. However, the composition of endogenous HS and their specific roles in healthy aged and disease-affected brain are unknown. I found that mice expressing shorter HS chains showed prolonged survival and profoundly altered prion plaque distribution in brain when infected with a plaque-forming prion strain, but did not show any change in the prion disease phenotype caused by aggregate-forming prions. Here I will define the HS molecules that bind to physiological and misfolded prion protein in different neuronal populations. I hypothesize that the interaction of HS with misfolded prions is a major determinant underlying the selective cell vulnerability in prion disease. In Aim 1, I will determine the role of HS sulfation in the prion replication i) in vitro, using HS isolated from distinct neuronal populations, and ii) in vivo, by mouse models deficient in HS sulfation. I will measure how the variation in the HS sulfation impacts the PrP cell tropism and lesion targets in the brain, and how age affects HS composition. I will next manipulate the HS composition in different neuronal populations i) to measure the selective cell uptake of prions strains and their degree of dependence on HS (Aim 2), and ii) to test a new strategy to block prion progression based on using HSPG mimetics as vehicles to promote prion degradation in lysosomes (Aim 3). I expect to define the molecular mechanisms underlying selective cell vulnerability in prion disease and to discover new targets for the rational design of neuroprotective therapies for patients with prion disease. Due to the many commonalities between the pathogenesis of prion disease and Alzheimer's disease, I plan to ultimately extend my research strategy to the study of cell targeting by amyloid-β.

Oral HIV transmission occurs in two distinct settings, breast milk consumption by infants born to HIV-infected women and receptive oral contact with semen from an HIV-infected partner. For HIV+ mothers the benefits of breastfeeding to infant health often outweigh the risk of HIV transmission, and as a result, ~150,000 infants are still infected with HIV each year. Additionally, epidemiological studies have provided clear evidence that HIV can be transmitted through receptive oral intercourse. To date, studies assessing mucosal SIV transmission have been impeded by the difficulties associated with not knowing exactly when and where the transmission event has taken place. For example, when evaluating oral SIV transmission, we previously identified SIV DNA and RNA in lymph nodes throughout the body at 24 and 48 hours but were unable to determine if the transmission event occurred at one or multiple locations throughout the upper digestive tract. This proposal addresses this issue through the use of innovative techniques that we developed and optimized for HIV vaccine delivery and evaluation of changes in the draining lymph nodes following an intraepithelial (intraepithelial) vaccine injection to the oral mucosa. Here we utilize intraepithelial injection to deliver the SIV virus directly into the intraepithelial space, a location associated with SIV entry and replication following mucosal infection. This Precision Mucosal Infection (Precision Mucosal Infection) model allows us to know the exact location of the mucosal infection. In our preliminary data, we have used Precision Mucosal Infection successfully to initiate both oral and rectal mucosal infections in macaques. Importantly, by precisely defining the site of infection, enabled us to develop Lymphatic Tracking by Indocyanine green dye (Lymphatic Tracking by Indocyanine green dye) to identify with exquisite specificity the first draining LNs to contact the SIV virus. We hypothesize that the first LNs to contact SIV are key to the initiation, breadth and magnitude of the antiSIV immune response, and early interventions designed to stimulate the innate or adaptive immune response has the potential to improve this initial lymphatic response. The three intervention strategies that will be evaluated are: A. Anti-retroviral therapy (Anti-retroviral therapy), B. Type-1 interferons (IFN1) and C. SIV-Env vaccine. The three aims of the proposal focus on immunological and virological assessments of different tissue sites impacted by the SIV infection mucosa (Aim 1), entry to the lymphatics (Aim 2) and systemically (Aim 3). This study makes use of novel targeted infection and sampling techniques pioneered by Dr. Smedley that allow for serial sampling of the site of infection and primary draining lymph nodes. The research has the potential to: 1. Provide insight into the earliest events following SIV infection. 2. Guide identification of therapies to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with oral transmission of HIV. 3. Guide the establishment of Precision Mucosal Infection and Lymphatic Tracking by Indocyanine green dye for future SIV infection experiments at other mucosal sites.

Evidence indicates that developmental exposures to ubiquitous environmental toxicants may disrupt neurobiological mechanisms that regulate sleep and allostasis. However, whether these exposures are modifiable risk factors for poor sleep during adolescence has not been rigorously examined. Our multidisciplinary project brings together experts in pediatric environmental health, sleep, and cardiometabolic health to identify whether early life exposure to environmental toxicant mixtures disrupts adolescent sleep health and increases allostatic load. This project focuses on mixtures of phthalates, per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances), and metals. Most pregnant people, infants, and children are exposed to mixtures of these toxicants through diet and consumer goods. The project leverages existing and new data from two well-characterized prospective pregnancy and birth cohorts, the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment) Study and the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals) Study. Both cohorts previously enrolled pregnant women and followed children until ages 7-9 (Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals n=300) or 10-12 (Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment n=256) years with additional visits underway at ages 10-12 (Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals) and 16-18 (Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment) years. Sleep characteristics will be examined at two timepoints in both cohorts using actigraphy. We will quantify relations between environmental toxicant biomarkers during gestation, early childhood, school age, and adolescence with sleep characteristics (Aim 1) and allostatic load (Aim 2) during adolescence. We will also examine whether exposure to environmental toxicant mixtures is associated with hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal) activity, catecholamines, and systemic inflammation, biological intermediates of sleep-wake regulation and allostasis (Aim 3). Our analyses will identify individual and joint effects of environmental toxicant mixtures and examine periods of heightened susceptibility during critical developmental periods. Identifying modifiable environmental factors that contribute to poor sleep health and allostatic load may inform novel interventions to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in adulthood worldwide.",5,5R01ES035133-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES,1,3,3,2

Racial and ethnic minority children with special health care needs are more likely to have these health conditions and less likely to have them diagnosed and treated compared with other children with special health care needs. Disparities in access to care contribute to disparities in use of behavioral health treatment, and inadequate insurance leads to poor health outcomes among children with special health care needs. Early identification and treatment for behavioral health conditions is critical to support the health and well-being of children with special health care needs over their lifetimes. Yet, many racial and ethnic minority families of children with special health care needs experience challenges in accessing needed behavioral health services. Disparities in behavioral health outcomes can be mitigated by expanding insurance coverage and encouraging use of treatment. Addressing these mechanisms early in life is critical to mitigate health disparities over the entire life course. There is mixed evidence on the extent to which general insurance expansions reduce disparities, and some studies even find that racial and ethnic disparities in coverage and health service use increased after recent health insurance expansions. Other policies, including streamlined or automatic enrollment in Medicaid, have been shown to increase Medicaid enrollment, retention and overall insurance coverage rates, but there is no evidence about the impact of these policies on disparities in coverage or utilization for racial/ethnic minority children with special health care needs, or children with special health care needs who have mental health conditions. Targeted interventions in expanding services may be more effective at reducing disparities for these populations but evidence on the effects of targeted interventions is limited. More research is needed to understand the extent to which targeted policies can reduce disparities in health insurance coverage and behavioral health care utilization among racial/ethnic minority children with special health care needs. This study will examine the effects of a targeted intervention to increase insurance coverage and behavioral health service utilization among racial and ethnic minority children with special health care needs: automatic enrollment in Medicaid via Supplemental Security Income (Supplemental Security Income). We propose two complementary analytic approaches, one with nationally representative survey data and one exploiting a natural experiment in Medicaid claims data. We will quantify the effects of Medicaid automatic enrollment via Supplemental Security Income on disparities in insurance coverage and behavioral health service use among racial and ethnic minority CHSCN; identify the demographics of children with special health care needs who are newly enrolled in Medicaid due to automatic enrollment policies and examine potential disparities in their health needs; and examine how the effects on behavioral health service use, health outcomes, and disparities in service use and outcomes evolve over time for newly enrolled children with special health care needs. Our findings will provide critical insights about how targeted Medicaid automatic enrollment could improve behavioral health outcomes for this underserved population and will contribute to broader understanding of how reducing administrative burden may improve health equity for disadvantaged and underserved children with special health care needs.",5,5R01MD017062-03,PAR-20-310,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES,1,5,3,2

A leading hypothesis is that most of this variation exerts its effects on cell-type-specific cisregulatory sequences (cisregulatory sequences). Interpreting such variation will therefore require quantitative models of the 'regulatory grammar' that controls the cell-type-specific activities of cisregulatory sequences. We define the regulatory grammar of a cell type to be the independent and interacting contributions of transcription factor binding sites (transcription factor binding sites) to cis-regulatory activity. Models of regulatory grammar must also include the dependencies of those contributions on the number, orientation, spacing, and affinity of transcription factor binding sites. Detailed models of regulatory grammars are still in their infancy, partly because we lack systematic training data for how cisregulatory sequences behave across diverse cell types in vivo. We propose to address this gap by systematically measuring the activities of cisregulatory sequences across cell types within intact mammalian tissues. To collect this data, we will introduce a single-cell massively parallel reporter gene assay (single-cell massively parallel reporter gene assay) that measures the cell-type-specific activities of cisregulatory sequences in vivo. We will model the resulting data using a formal thermodynamic model in which each TF-DNA or TF-TF interaction is represented by its free energy (ΔG) of interaction. By comparing the magnitudes of the resulting ΔG values, we will quantify the independent and interacting contributions of specific transcription factor binding sites, thus deriving quantitative regulatory grammars that capture the differences between cell types within the mammalian retina (Aim 1) and the mammalian brain (Aim 2). By validating our models on sequence variants of endogenous cisregulatory sequences, we hope to make progress towards a framework for accurately predicting the effects of non-coding genetic variation on the function of cisregulatory sequences.",5,5R01GM092910-14,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,10,10,2,0

The circadian (~24-h) system shifts later (delay) with the progression of puberty; this shift contributes to late sleep onsets in older adolescents. Early school start times force teenagers awake earlier than their spontaneous wake time. Thus, the opportunity for sleep shortens. Many adolescents are also waking for school at the ""wrong"" circadian time. Chronic circadian misalignment and sleep restriction are at their peak during late adolescence, and are associated with morning daytime sleepiness, poor academic performance, conduct problems, depressed mood, suicidal ideation, substance use, insulin resistance, and obesity. Bright light exposure from light boxes can shift rhythms earlier (phase advance) to facilitate earlier sleep onset, and reduce morning circadian misalignment and the associated risks. We constructed the first phase response curves (phase response curves) to bright light in older adolescents. To phase advance circadian rhythms, our phase response curves showed that the ideal time to begin light exposure was slightly before wake-up time and light should be avoided around bedtime because this is when light produces maximum phase delay shifts. An unexpected finding from our results, however, was a second advancing region in the afternoon (~6 to 9 h after habitual wake-up time) suggesting that afternoon light may have more circadian phase advancing ability than traditionally thought. The overall goal of this mechanistic study is to follow-up on our unexpected PRC findings and test whether individually-timed afternoon light alone and in combination with morning bright light can shift circadian rhythms earlier in older adolescents aged 14 to 17 years. Four groups will be compared in a randomized parallel group design: afternoon bright light, morning bright light, morning + afternoon bright light, and a dim room light control. Adolescents will complete a 2-week protocol. After a baseline week with a stable sleep schedule, adolescents will live in our laboratory for 4 days. Sleep/dark and the time of bright light exposure will gradually shift earlier. Bright light (~5000 lux) will be timed individually based on his/her stable baseline sleep schedule. The first 3-h morning bright light exposure will begin 1 h before wake on the first morning. The first 3-h afternoon bright light exposure will begin 6 h after wake. The morning + afternoon exposures will begin at the same times, but each exposure will be 1.5 h so that a total of 3 h of bright light per day will be given to each group except the dim light control group. Phase shifts of the circadian clocks marked by the dim light melatonin onset (dim light melatonin onset) is the main outcome. We hypothesize that afternoon bright light will advance dim light melatonin onset more than dim room light and afternoon bright light will work synergistically with morning bright light to produce larger shifts than morning or afternoon bright light alone. If our hypotheses are supported, these data will challenge the current understanding of how to use bright light to shift the circadian system earlier.",5,5R01HL151512-05,PA-19-055,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",1,3,8,2

The main therapy for angiomyolipoma is everolimus, a rapamycin analog inhibitor of the kinase mTOR with cytostatic activity that only partially reduces tumor size. angiomyolipomas become stable over time, and tumor re-growth is often occurs after treatment is interrupted due to side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to elucidate mechanisms of tumor resistance for the development of more efficacious therapies. Efforts to recapitulate angiomyolipoma experimentally have failed for the past 20+ years, precluding the study of angiomyolipoma biology. To address this problem, we have used genetically engineered patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (induced pluripotent stem cells) to generate angiomyolipoma organoids. Organoids generated from induced pluripotent stem cells carrying biallelic inactivating mutations in the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex2 locus (i.e. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex2-/-) faithfully recapitulated key anatomical and molecular features of human kidney angiomyolipoma (reported in Hernandez JOR et al. Nat Commun. 2021 Nov 11;12:6496). Some of those features included the presence of myomelanocytic angiomyolipoma-like cells co-expressing smooth muscle and melanocyte markers, and the transcriptional activation of signaling pathways shared with kidney angiomyolipoma. Transplantation of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex2-/- angiomyolipoma organoids into the kidneys of immunodeficient rodents resulted in fully vascularized human angiomyolipoma xenografts for mechanistic studies and for drug testing testing in vivo. Using these novel tools we identified potential mechanisms of tumor resistance driven by p21CIP1 and by BCL-2 apoptosis modulators, preventing angiomyolipoma cell death induced by rapalogs. Our in vivo experiments also indicated that drug delivery via nanocarriers may increase the efficacy of anti-tumor therapy while reducing undesired effects in other tissues. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate anti-apoptotic mechanisms driven by p21CIP1 and BCL-2 proteins for the development of novel anti-tumor therapies combining BCL-2 protein inhibitor drugs and rapalogs, that can be co-delivered using tissue-targeting nanoparticles. Our long-term goal is to design new therapies for angiomyolipoma with increased efficacy and specificity. The central hypothesis is that antiapoptotic mechanisms driven by p21CIP1 and BCL-2 apoptosis inhibitors sustain angiomyolipoma cell survival promoting tumor resistance to rapalog therapy. Our three aims are: Aim 1: To investigate anti-apoptotic mechanisms of tumor resistance driven by p21CIP1 in renal angiomyolipoma; Aim 2: To elucidate the role of IGFBP2 in stabilizing p21CIP1 promoting angiomyolipoma cell survival; Aim 3: To study the contribution of BCL-2 proteins to angiomyolipoma cell survival through pharmacologic blockage of BH3 domain interaction. Collectively, these studies will provide much needed insight into the mechanisms of angiomyolipoma and will assess the efficacy of BCL-2 inhibitor therapy alone or in combination with rapalogs in angiomyolipoma-targeting nanoparticles.",5,5R01CA269583-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Persistent activation of the Integrated Stress Response (Integrated Stress Response) signaling is also observed in both mouse and human atheroma. Integrated Stress Response is an elaborate, homeostatic signaling activated by a range of conditions such as hypoxia, hyperlipidemia and endoplasmic reticulum (endoplasmic reticulum) and mitochondrial stress, which are known to promote atherosclerosis. Small molecules and genetic models that prevent hypercholesterolemia-induced Integrated Stress Response signaling were shown to prevent atherosclerosis progression, demonstrating Integrated Stress Response's causality in atherosclerosis development. Despite regulating lipid-induced sterile inflammation, thereby representing a novel therapeutic opportunity in cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular disease), therapeutic targeting of a homeostatic pathway such as Integrated Stress Response in a chronic disease is not without its challenges. Deciphering the detailed mechanisms by which Integrated Stress Response governs macrophage immunometabolism and atherogenesis can pave the way to effective and specific therapeutic strategies in cardiovascular disease while escaping toxicity that may be associated with targeting homeostatic signaling. We made the striking discovery that Integrated Stress Response inhibition in hypercholesterolemic mice leads to increased 5hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) to 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) ratio in macrophages and plaques while reducing IL-1b and atherosclerosis progression. The oxidation of 5-mC to 5-hmC is catalyzed by Ten eleven translocation (Ten eleven translocation) family of methylcytosine dioxygenases, somatic mutations in which are associated with coronary heart disease and early-onset myocardial infarction (myocardial infarction). The inactivation of Ten eleven translocation-2 in mice promotes atherosclerosis progression and cardiac dysfunction. Our robust preliminary data shows that hypercholesterolemia induces 2hydroxyglutarate (2HG), a potent Ten eleven translocation inhibitory metabolite, in an Integrated Stress Response-dependent manner. Furthermore, supplementation with a-ketoglutarate (a-ketoglutarate), a cofactor for Ten eleven translocation, stimulates Ten eleven translocation activity while inhibiting IL-1b secretion in mouse and human macrophages. a-ketoglutarate supplementation in a small group of hypercholesterolemic mice prevented inflammation while reversing Ten eleven translocation inhibition. Building on the insight gained through our robust preliminary studies and incorporating additional evidence from literature, we hypothesize that hyperlipidemiainduced Integrated Stress Response signaling generates an immunometabolite that can promote macrophage inflammatory response and atherosclerosis. We propose to investigate ATF4's role in regulating macrophage immunometabolism and promoting atherosclerosis in vivo. We will also investigate the consequences of modulating 2HG levels in myeloid cells on inflammation and atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic mice. The completion of the proposed studies will illuminate the metabolic and epigenetic consequences for Integrated Stress Response signaling in macrophages on sterile inflammation and atherosclerosis development. The new knowledge gained through these studies could pave the way for the development of effective and specific therapeutic strategies to antagonize Integrated Stress Response signaling components that promote sterile inflammation and drive atherosclerosis progression.",5,5R01HL160860-03,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",12,2,0,0

The hematopoietic system and the gastrointestinal (gastrointestinal) tract are among the most vulnerable tissues to radiation injury. High-dose radiation results in gastrointestinal syndrome characterized by microbiome dysbiosis, destruction of mucosal layer, intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction, and aberrant inflammatory responses that initiate a vicious cycle of further gastrointestinal tract damage that can lead to rapid death. Although progress has been made to counteract the immediate effects of hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome, no FDA-approved countermeasures exist that can treat radiation-induced gastrointestinal injury. To meet this critical need, Synedgen Inc., has developed a glycopolymer radiomitigator (MIIST305) that is specifically targeted to the gastrointestinal tract that could potentially ameliorate the deleterious effects of radiation. The therapeutic drug has been shown to reduce cell death, suppress local and systemic inflammation, and improve tissue regeneration in models associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Our preliminary studies have shown that MIIST305 confers significant survival to mice exposed to high-dose partial body x-irradiation, when administered 24 hours post-irradiation. Furthermore, MIIST305 appears to promote pro-inflammatory resolution and maintain more normal gut microbiota composition in response to gastrointestinal injury. We hypothesize that MIIST305 maintains the integrity of the mucosal layer thus preserving a healthy microbiome in response to irradiation, minimizing disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier function and alleviating inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will perform longitudinal structural and functional studies to determine the impact of acute dose, partial body irradiation with 5% bone marrow sparing on gastrointestinal architectural integrity, commensal gut microbiota composition and diversity, and inflammation compared to MIIST305-mitigated animals. In Aim 2, we will define the importance of MIIST305-regulated commensal microbiota composition and elucidate the molecular pathways leading to MIIST305 suppression of the pro-inflammatory response and ultimately, mitigation of radiation-induced toxicity, using both transgenic mouse models and cell-based assays. To address the overarching goals of this funding announcement, we propose to (a) explore how the microbiome affects severity of radiation injury, (b) develop novel countermeasures against radiation-induced gastrointestinal damage with efficacy starting 24 hours after radiation exposure, and (c) define the mechanism of action of the countermeasures, which will provide the necessary information for FDA approval under the Animal Rule.",5,5U01AI172853-02,RFA-AI-21-068,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,3,4,0,0

Yet, traditional ensemble analytical tools for investigating mechanisms, like NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, measure primarily the major components in mixtures and provide averaged and non-spatially resolved information, thus missing key reaction intermediates and distributions of behaviors. Approach: Here, focusing on two challenging systems-aqueous-surfactant emulsions for sustainable organic chemistry in water and the synthesis of organometallic reagents and catalytic intermediates directly from metal powders-we now develop fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy) methods. These methods overcome the limitations of prior analytical techniques and, we propose, lead to exciting insights into previously poorly understood classes of organic reactions and processes. Innovation: The experiments described here are the first fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy studies of any synthetic organic chemistry reactions or processes under preparative conditions. We innovate by using this spatially resolved fluorescence lifetime data to characterize reaction intermediates, assign fates of catalysts, understand reaction mechanisms, and create predictive reaction models. Significance: Information gained from these fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy studies provides guiding principles for surfactant selection and medium recycling in sustainable aqueous-organic systems, efficient methods for accessing organometallic reagents, and tactics for lowering temperatures, ligand quantities, and/or catalyst amounts in carbon-carbon bond-forming cross-coupling reactions. We focus our efforts on understanding and developing areas of high significance: organozinc, organocopper, and organopalladium reagent and/or catalytic intermediate syntheses, as well as Negishi, Suzuki, and Heck cross-coupling reactions, with applications in the synthesis of drug-like molecules. Beyond uncovering guiding principles, we plan to develop next-generation chemical imaging agents and strategies, including autofluorescence methods that function in the absence of exogenous imaging agents. Instead, these methods will harness the inherent fluorescence lifetime and emission signatures of native reaction components. Once developed, these imaging tools will be primed for use by our laboratory and others for the broader study of mechanisms and processes in synthetic organic chemistry. Expertise in our diverse team uniquely encompasses fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, organic synthesis methods development, transition-metal chemistry, catalysis, surface characterization, and mechanistic studies-exactly the angles needed for the success of this ambitious, multidisciplinary proposal, as demonstrated by robust preliminary results and an impactful publication record. Together, these studies have a positive impact because they lead to efficient, sustainable routes for the construction of carbon-carbon bonds and organometallic reagents and catalysts, thus facilitating the next generation of therapeutic agents used to treat human diseases.",1,1R35GM153291-01,PAR-22-180,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

These complex biochemical machines synthesize proteins at a rate of 200 amino acids per minute with extremely high efficiency and fidelity. Germline or somatic defects in genes encoding components or regulators for ribosome assembly or function cause ribosomopathies, which occur in pediatric and adult patients. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (Shwachman-Diamond syndrome) is a prototypic ribosomopathy. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, neutropenia, skeletal dysplasia, and short stature. Genetic ablation of Sbds results in early embryonic lethality (ED 6.5) in mice. The zebrafish Sbds protein is ~90% identical to the human ortholog. We created sbds, efl1, and eif6 zebrafish knockout strains that phenocopy Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. Based on biochemical and genetic analysis of human and fish tissues, we hypothesize that the loss of SBDS produces disease due to EIF6 accumulation and subsequent aberrant metabolism. When these biochemical responses are excessive, metabolic defects, growth arrest, cell death, and tissue atrophy ensue. Initially adaptive, TP53 mutations may become maladaptive. Using available zebrafish, cell lines, and patient-derived tissues and established methods, we propose the following specific aim to address our hypothesis: Identify the cellular compartment for EIF6 accumulation and characterize its effects on metabolic pathways that could contribute to the pathogenesis of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.

To overcome longstanding limitations in prostate cancer staging, several positron-emission tomography (positron-emission tomography) scans have recently been approved and rapidly integrated into clinical care based on evidence of improved diagnostic accuracy. However, the consequences of widespread positron-emission tomography imaging are unknown. This is because the approvals of these tests are based on improved diagnostic accuracy, a surrogate endpoint, rather than direct evidence of patient benefit. By finding small sites of cancer earlier, positron-emission tomography imaging could introduce a cascade of effects-both positive and negative-that could vary from patient to patient. positron-emission tomography imaging could lead to improved survival and fewer symptoms from metastatic cancer in a subset, but could also increase treatment toxicity, psychological burdens, and costs in others. Currently, no information is available to help guide patients or stakeholders when considering these tradeoffs. To reduce these uncertainties, our goal is to develop a decision model that considers the effects of positron-emission tomography imaging across multiple dimensions. To inform this model, we will generate realworld evidence from a diversity of sources. In aim one, we will conduct complementary analyses of large, nationally representative databases to evaluate the effectiveness of positron-emission tomography imaging, focusing on the associations between imaging initiation of systemic therapy, progression to hormone-refractory disease, and costs. In aim two, we will measure the longitudinal impact of positron-emission tomography imaging on patient-reported outcome measures relating to psychological effects (anxiety and uncertainty) and health-related quality of life. To gain a deeper perspective about patient experiences with testing we will also conduct longitudinal qualitative interviews among a smaller subset of patients and integrate the findings from quantitative and qualitative sources.

The results of this study will equip patients, providers, and other prostate cancer stakeholders with practical, new information about the potential short and long-term effects of positron-emission tomography imaging.

The immense advances in our genetic understanding of mammalian development over the past four decades have not yet translated into better preventative or therapeutic options for babies with birth defects. Our ability to address this high unmet need depends critically on the discovery and detailed mechanistic understanding of molecular and cellular pathways that drive human developmental defects. Working with a multidisciplinary investigative team that combines expertise in signal transduction, human genetics and bone biology, we have discovered an novel inter-organelle communication mechanism that links protein N-glycosylation in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (Endoplasmic Reticulum) to the reception of WNT signals at the cell surface. The WNT/β-catenin pathway is a key cell-cell communication system that regulates tissue patterning during development and regenerative responses in adults. Human genetic studies from our collaborators show that this Endoplasmic Reticulum-based pathway is disrupted in a severe, deforming subtype of the inherited bone fragility disorder Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Osteogenesis Imperfecta) and in subtypes of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation), characterized by developmental defects across tissues. Given that over 25% of proteins encoded in our genomes are N-glycosylated, we propose the existence of a surveillance mechanism (analogous to the unfolded protein response) that ensures WNT-driven differentiation is only allowed to proceed if the Endoplasmic Reticulum N-glycosylation machinery is intact. The three goals of this proposal are to delineate the components and transduction mechanisms of this regulated N-glycosylation pathway, understand its role in osteoblast differentiation and bone matrix production and establish its relevance to human birth defect syndromes. We use genome-wide CRISPR screens and mass spectrometry to identify pathway components, gene-editing to disrupt or mutate these components in both cell lines and primary cells from human Osteogenesis Imperfecta patients, and mechanistic studies to understand how N-glycosylation in the Endoplasmic Reticulum tunes WNT ligand sensitivity at the cell surface. Successful completion of this project will define a new pathway that regulates WNT signaling and human development by using N-glycosylation as a regulatory post-translational modification. More broadly, our work will define a largely unexplored signaling function for N-glycosylation, a fundamental cell biological process linked to diseases across multiple organ systems.",1,1R01HD113790-01,PA-20-185,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,5,14,2,0

We have closely examined the interaction between capsule and vascular endothelial cells (vascular endothelial cells) and developed the hypothesis that capsule dynamics are complex and impact all stages of Streptococcus pneumoniae translocation across vascular endothelial cells. This includes attachment, receptor mediated endocytosis (receptor mediated endocytosis), resistance to intracellular killing, and trafficking to the basolateral surface for organ invasion. Testing of our hypothesis will reveal the intracellular mechanics of Streptococcus pneumoniae trafficking that drive organ invasion. Our results will impact risk assessment strategies for serotype-based vaccine design. AIM 1. Determine how serotype impacts platelet-activating factor receptor (platelet-activating factor receptor) and laminin-receptor initiated adhesion/uptake of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Our preliminary results indicate capsule has serotype-variable antagonistic effects on the bacterium's interaction with host cells that affects receptor mediated endocytosis. We will use a comprehensive panel of isogenic capsule switch mutants of low and high invasive disease capability, specifically focusing on serotypes belonging to the same serogroup, i.e., having single and defined molecular differences in their capsule structure, to determine how specific biochemical features, such as acetylation, affect interactions with both peripheral and cerebral vascular endothelial cells. We will quantify serotype dependence of surface exposure of the Streptococcus pneumoniae adhesins phosphorylcholine (phosphorylcholine) and choline binding protein A (choline binding protein A), its effect on adhesion to their ligands platelet-activating factor receptor and LR, respectively, on receptor-initiated signaling responsible for uptake, and in summate, on invasion rate. AIM 2. Determine how serotype influences the path taken by intracellular Streptococcus pneumoniae for translocation vs recycling vs removal. The degradation of cargo taken up by receptor mediated endocytosis in non-phagocytic cells is mediated by the novel LC3-associated endocytic recycling pathway `LANDO'. Thus, LANDO is likely a critical pathway co-opted by the pneumococcus to cross vascular endothelial cells. Using low and highly invasive capsule mutant swaps, we will determine the ability of platelet-activating factor receptor and LR to initiate LANDO. We will subsequently determine the impact of capsule and serotype on Streptococcus pneumoniae trafficking across wild type vs LANDO deficient vascular endothelial cells in vitro. We will characterize targeting of Streptococcus pneumoniae into heart and brain of pafr-/-, LANDO deficient, and LR-blocked mice, thereby assessing how capsule modulates vital endocytic processes at the crossroads of bacterial translocation vs death in the lysosome. AIM 3. Determine how capsule shedding impacts bacterial fate within vascular endothelial cells. Whereas pneumococci in the bloodstream are encapsulated when taken up by vascular endothelial cells, our results suggest capsule is shed within the endosome following receptor mediated endocytosis and provides protection from low pH and oxidative stress which are deployed to kill the bacterium. We will determine the status of capsule (shed or unshed) and the importance of shedding on Streptococcus pneumoniae as they cross the vascular endothelial cells. We will determine if serotype impacts the kinetics of capsule shedding by Streptococcus pneumoniae and how capsule type and shedding influences endosome acidification and lysosome fusion.",5,5R01AI172796-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

Currently, there is a lack of consensus regarding how to define and parcellate even the earliest regions of auditory cortex, including primary auditory region A1, highlighting the significant gaps in our overall understanding of sound processing. Traditional approaches to defining primary auditory regions in humans include identifying the macroanatomical landmarks known as the Heshl's gyri (Heshl's gyri) in each hemisphere and using their locations as a rough approximation of A1. While macroscopic anatomical information, such as the sulcal and gyral patterning in auditory cortex, can provide a rough estimate of where primary auditory regions are located, it is not sufficiently accurate. This is likely due to the high degree of variability in the size, shape, location, and number of Heshl's gyris found in the auditory cortices of humans. Conversely, attempts to use functional properties-in particular, frequency mapping (tonotopy)-have also been met with limited success, as tonotopic gradients cannot be used to uniquely position the areal boundaries of A1. Aim 1 of the proposed research will exploit recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging) to non-invasively acquire unprecedentedly high-resolution in vivo human anatomical data at the mesoscopic scale (~0.35mm3), revealing biological information that was not previously available via neuroimaging. Access to this information will allow us to generate detailed, data-driven parcellations of auditory cortices that more closely match the underlying cytoarchitecture. Aim 2 will complement the anatomical approaches in Aim 1 by defining A1 in the same set of individuals, using several high-field cortical and subcortical measures of functional activation derived using both task-based and functional connectivity paradigms. The task-based functional data will be used to construct tuning maps for several key perceptually-relevant acoustic features, the parcellation of which will be constrained by the patterns of resting state connectivity between sub-cortical and cortical regions. Work from both aims, which includes mesoscopic magnetic resonance imaging, subcortical neuroimaging, computational modeling, and resting state connectivity, will be combined to provide the auditory neuroimaging community with a state-of-the-art multimodal structure-function characterization of primary auditory cortex in humans. To aid in the standardization of auditory cortex characterizations in future studies, this information will be made publicly available, along with an atlas. The long-term goal is a complete characterization and parcellation of auditory cortex in humans. The resulting parcellations in normal-hearing populations will serve as a baseline for characterizing and subsequently developing effective treatments for auditory processing deficits in hearing-impaired populations.",5,5R21DC020530-02,PAR-21-107,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,0,1,5,1

The aging population and utilization of emergency care combine to create an opportunity in the care continuum to detect and change patient care trajectories and underscore the urgency to identify and disseminate best practices in geriatrics and dementia emergency care. Unfortunately, due to the lack of infrastructure, there is a paucity of research to guide this work. The field is limited by lack of standardization and few estimates of effectiveness of interventions and geriatric care delivered at facilities that report Geriatric Emergency Department (Gemergency department) programs. We have built and designed an early research infrastructure, the Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research (Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research) network to meet this critical need. Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research is a growing network of health systems with Gemergency departments, transdisciplinary researchers, and content experts that have created a multicenter database and pilot study opportunities focused on aging studies in geriatric and dementia emergency care. We will grow the Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research (Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research 1.1) network by expanding and leveraging the research data infrastructure established during its first phase, going from 4 to 7 health systems, from 6 to 47 hospitals, representing over 2.2M emergency department encounters made by over 684K unique patients. The Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research 1.1 Ecosystem will be available to the general research community, supporting efficient access to and use of large, multicenter datasets for the conduct of geriatric and dementia-related emergency care aging studies, including the ability to focus on health disparities. Specifically, we will:  Increase the number of sites and data capabilities of Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research,  Coordinate data harmonization and data linkage development across multiple sites including NIA LINKAGE between Medicare and Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research 1.1 data, and  Conduct multicenter evaluations, including small-scale pilot studies that leverage the Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research Ecosystem to address research gaps identified by Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research priority populations. We will expand and build upon an early platform from which Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research and future investigators will be able to generate and use the data for multicenter projects, conduct larger scale observational studies, and emulate multicenter clinical trials. This will grow intraand inter-networks both within and across participating healthcare systems promoting the spread and partnerships of transdisciplinary aging studies and sciences. Now that the initial Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research network has laid the groundwork, Geriatric Emergency care Applied Research 1.1 will solidify the foundation to create a more mature and sustainable research infrastructure to support the development of an evidence-base for high-quality geriatric and dementia emergency care.",2,2R33AG058926-08,PAR-23-054,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,13,12,7,2

However, a major obstacle limiting more effective and durable vaccines against influenza infection stem from the rapidly shifting nature of viral immune dominant epitopes. Further confounding this obstacle are functional differences in the immunological responsiveness to vaccination and susceptibility of individuals to natural infection primed by prior exposure to influenza antigens. This type of immunological imprinting likely explains the wide discordance in effectiveness of current seasonal influenza vaccines. Considering the near ubiquitous exposure of individuals to influenza virus, together with the wide variability in clinical symptoms from asymptomatic to severe infection and increasingly widespread use of seasonal immunization, immunological imprinting to influenza virus is likely initiated during infancy with the first exposure to natural infection or immunization. Importantly, critical knowledge gaps remain regarding how individuals respond to primary influenza exposure in early life, in the context of natural infection or vaccination, and how a lack of pre-existing immunity effects within-host influenza viral diversity. It is also unclear how this first exposure to influenza impacts the subsequent immunological responsiveness to antigenically identical, similar or discordant influenza epitopes. For infants, the impact of vertically transferred maternal immunity, or that acquired postnatally through breastfeeding, on the quality of ensuing influenza specific immune responses remain unclear. To fill these knowledge gaps, ongoing recruitment of a maternal-infant cohort at Cincinnati Children's Hospital will be expanded, along with parallel efforts in Mexico City. Both sites have ongoing surveillance providing additional cases of symptomatic primary infection. With the proposed enrollment of more than 2000 pregnant women, our two-site cohort is ideally suited for the proposed studies given our established infrastructure of weekly nasal swabs and symptom reporting, scheduled blood collection to detect asymptomatic and symptomatic influenza, maternal and cord blood and milk sample analyses and detailed evaluations of susceptibility and immunological responses to influenza infection and vaccination in mothers and infants. Our overall hypothesis is that primary influenza exposure in early life impacts the magnitude, durability and breadth of immunological memory to an evolving range of influenza virus antigens and this initial imprint will have a profound effect on subsequent influenza exposures. A team of investigators with complementary expertise in pediatric infectious diseases, epidemiology, maternal-infant cohorts, human B and T cell immunology and influenza virology have been assembled to address our hypothesis by investigating the immunological response of infants to primary influenza virus natural infection compared with immunization (Aim 1), compare the immunological response against an initial exposure to influenza virus via natural infection or immunization in infants (Aim 2), and investigating the impact of pre-existing influenza immunity on virus genetic diversity within individuals (Aim 3).",5,5U01AI144673-06,RFA-AI-18-010,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

A subgroup of these patients with ABCA4 bi-allelic truncation mutations show a loss of central cones during childhood that is followed by an ""explosive"" centrifugal progression of photoreceptor degeneration leading also to peripheral visual malfunction. The proposal builds on success achieved during the current grant period in moving AAV-based gene therapy for RPGR-XLRP to a human clinical trial, as well as developing and validating in a canine model a novel gene therapy for another severe and early-onset ciliopathy, NPHP5LCA. Results in the dog have shown that the cone-rich central retina can be targeted and rescued even when intervention occurs at late stages of cone disease, a finding that is highly relevant to this proposal. We have recently identified a loss of function mutation in the canine ABCA4 gene that causes a retinal phenotype with striking similarities with human ABCA4-CRD: early accumulation of lipofuscin in the cone-rich central retina followed by pan-retinal degeneration later in life. We will capitalize on availability of this model to improve our understanding of ABCA4 disease and develop a nanoparticle-mediated gene therapy that can accommodate delivery of the large size of this gene. Our proposal is divided into four aims that will: 1establish the natural history of disease in the canine model; 2optimize a lead nanoparticle construct that can efficiently transduce cones, rods and RPE in rodents and dogs; 3identify the optimal route of delivery, dose, and lead vector to target the cone-rich canine central retina, in preparation for 4proof of concept studies in ABCA4-mutant dogs treated at early and later stages of cone disease/degeneration. While the test system is the ABCA4-mutant dog model, the therapeutic questions that are addressed apply broadly to other retinopathies caused by mutations in large size genes whose delivery may benefit from the development and validation of this nanoparticle delivery platform. The research studies described in this proposal represent a continuation of a longstanding collaboration between a group of vision scientists at the University of Pennsylvania that already have brought retinal gene therapy to the clinic for RPE65-LCA, CNGB3achromatopsia , and RPGR-XLRP. This new program will greatly benefit from the joint expertise of a consortium of investigators from three academic institutions (University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins University, and Columbia University) that will provide the necessary knowledge in ABCA4 biology, nanoparticle-mediated DNA transfer, small and large animal models, and human ABCA4 disease, to address the current unmet medical need for a treatment for this most common form of inherited retinal degeneration.",5,5R01EY017549-18,PA-20-185,NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE,18,13,9,1

The polycistronic SNURF-SNRPN-snoRNA locus encoding 2 proteins and 5 snoRNAs, including SNORD116 as one major gene, is important in determining phenotype. Treatment in Prader Willi syndrome uses early clinical and molecular diagnosis with behavioral modification, growth hormone, or ongoing drug trials that affect hyperphagia or behavior, but are limited by an incomplete understanding of pleiotropic phenotypes. Although these measures improve outcomes, none are a cure and significant clinical morbidity persists. Potential approaches for epigenetic or genetic therapy to reactivate or replace silent or missing Prader Willi syndrome-genes are complicated by heterochromatic silencing and the many genes involved in disease. This project will test an innovative approach involving miniaturization of Prader Willi syndrome genetic elements into a single therapeutic adeno-associated virus (AAV)-vector. The new AAV vector series will assess feasibility to replace 80% of Prader Willi syndrome-genes, helping to determine how and which gene losses lead to cellular and biochemical phenotypes in Prader Willi syndrome. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that Prader Willi syndrome-minigenes in an AAV-vector will appropriately express Prader Willi syndrome gene products in cells. The Prader Willi syndrome-minigenes include SNURF-SNRPN in the endogenous bicistronic layout with up to 5 snoRNAs, and the NDN-cistron, between AAV inverted terminal repeats. Use of human gene sequences in rodent cells will distinguish expression of exogenous and endogenous loci. Alternative vector structures will encode individual or clustered snoRNAs in SNURF-SNRPN introns or, to mimic the endogenous organization, in 3' introns. To reduce AAV vector size, and mimic endogenous regulation, a synthetic NRF1-motif array mini-promoter having broad cell-specificity for expression will be used, with all coding content of Prader Willi syndrome-minigenes within AAV packaging capacity. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that AAV-minigenes can rescue Prader Willi syndrome cellular phenotypes. A Prader Willi syndrome β-cell (INS-1) model shows a cell-autonomous defect in insulin secretion and deficits in RNA and protein production of multiple hormones and ER chaperones, which derive from loss of one or more of the Snurf-Snrpn-snoRNA genes. AAV-Prader Willi syndrome minigene vectors packaged as serotype AAV6 (optimal for rodent endocrine cells) will be transduced into control and Prader Willi syndrome β-cell lines (3 each), assessing correction in levels of insulin secretion, mRNA and protein levels of peptide hormones (e.g., insulins, IAPP) and ER chaperones (e.g., HSPA5, HSP90B1). Aim 3 (in vivo translation) tests the hypothesis that AAV-minigenes can rescue the pancreatic islet phenotypes and neonatal lethality of a mouse model lacking expression of all Prader Willi syndrome-genes. Therapeutic outcomes of AAV injections in utero vs. postnatal day 1 will be compared. Miniaturization of genetic components in a single AAV vector represents a remarkable opportunity for in vivo gene therapy of not only Prader Willi syndrome but more broadly in disease.",5,5R21HD108695-02,PA-20-195,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,11,7,6,1

Today, we state of the art super-resolution imaging along with molecular genetics, protein biochemistry, interaction and in vitro reconstitution, to gain more detailed insights into the structure and regulation of these polymers and their associated proteins, which comprise the dynamic membrane-associated nanomachine (the divisome) that divides bacterial cells. Our early characterization of hypermorphic of FtsA and FtsZ paved the way for a model, now strongly supported by numerous studies, that the E. divisome initially assembles in an inactive form, then becomes activated mainly by changes in protein and oligomeric state. Nonetheless, many f t he mechanisms that trigger and respond to these and oligomeric changes remain unclear. In the last grant period, we used our expertise in cellular imaging, and in vivo crosslinking to discover novel and physiologically significant proteininteractions among essential divisome proteins and develop new tools to study their function. As a we overturned several long-established assumptions about how FtsA, FtsZ and t heir binding partners and function. In addition, in collaborative studies we explored the ability of FtsZ to form l iquid-liquid condensates, which have the potential to transform how we think about the divisome and its response stress. In this proposal, we plan to continue our investigation of the cellular implications of molecular-scale using the E. coli divisome as the model but also expanding our studies of the divisome of Bacillus , the predominant Gram-positive model. We will address the most pressing questions about bacterial division, which include how protein-protein interactions and switches in protein conformation and tate sequentially trigger setup and assembly of the divisome;  how a third stage, synthesis of division eptum, is licensed and activated;  how the divisome interfaces with chromosome segregation cell wall synthesis. As we have done extensively in the past and in the last grant period, we will leverage approaches with collaborations.

The etiology of these complex polymicrobial diseases is poorly described by Koch's Postulates and the key mechanisms of polymicrobial pathogenesis are still emerging in the field. The limited utility of traditional antibiotic therapies as well as our inadequate understanding of polymicrobial disease etiology are both currently significant hurdles for the effective treatment of these diseases. The thematic basis for the current proposal is to utilize genetically tractable members of the oral flora as a model system to investigate the mechanistic and regulatory foundations of polymicrobial synergy as well as potential mechanisms to counteract synergistic pathogenesis in these types of diseases. The proposed research program will consist of 3 conceptually complementary research foci: 1) the genetic control of virulence, 2) mechanisms of polymicrobial synergy, and 3) novel strategies for targeted inhibition of bacteria. Success in each of these focus areas will be leveraged by our established strengths in oral bacterial genetics and the application of a state-of-the-art genetic system. We are proposing to further develop Streptococcus mutans as a preeminent model organism for genetic studies of flora pathobiology, while also developing a new model system of polymicrobial synergy using abscess clinical isolates of Anginosus group streptococci in combination with abscess clinical isolates of Fusobacterium spp. and Prevotella spp. The Anginosus streptococci are vastly understudied members of the oral flora strongly associated with the formation of severe polymicrobial abscesses in the oral cavity and throughout the body. Such abscesses are surprisingly common, yet little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms involved, other than the essential role of polymicrobial synergy, especially with Fusobacterium and Prevotella species.

In the model that established protection by VHHkappa adducts against influenza, the underlying mechanism of action involves antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (complement-dependent cytotoxicity), but the relative contribution of each is not known. We shall therefore use FcgR common g chain-deficient mice and C3deficient mice to assess the relative contributions of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. The generation of Fc constructs of different Ig isotypes and bearing FcR-engagement disabling mutations, similarly modified with zanamivir, will be used to complement this analysis. Having established proof-of-concept for influenza and optimized parameters for elimination of influenza virusinfected cells, we will explore nanobodies that recognize other pathogens (Ebola virus, SARS-CoV-2, HIV) in combination with VHHkappa in a series of collaborative experiments. The agents to be developed may inspire novel immunomodulatory therapeutics, to be used as a stand-alone approach, or in combination with approved drugs. The possibilities of post-exposure prophylaxis against viral infections (Ebola, SARS-CoV-2, HIV) in the absence of pre-existing immunity, deserve particular emphasis. We shall further enhance the activity of the proposed VHHkappa fusions through the generation of the corresponding drug adducts, using cytotoxic drugs such as maytansinoids as compounds that have shown clinical utility. Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV, SARS-CoV-2) export viral proteins to the surface of the infected cell during budding. Infected cells can thus be distinguished from uninfected cells based on the surface display of viral proteins. We now extend these in vivo observations to fusions of VHHkappa with anti-checkpoint (PD-L1, CTLA-4) nanobodies. We generated maytansinoid-modified VHHkappa fusions with the anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 VHHs. Our preliminary data show enhanced anti-tumor activity in the MC38 and B16.F10 mouse tumor models in comparison with commonly used monoclonal antibodies.

Although dentists administer and prescribe a limited number of medications in routine practice, many of these medications carry a high risk for human error and complications. High-risk medications are frequently prescribed and administered by dentists to children and have resulted in serious unintended consequences, including adverse events - such as death - during conscious sedation or general anesthesia, and the overprescribing of opioids. More than 100,000 pediatric dental sedations are performed annually in the U.S. The most common medications used for these procedures are benzodiazepines, opioids, and general anesthetics. All are associated with serious adverse events, including hypoxemia, respiratory depression, airway obstruction and death. Most Americans have their first exposure to opioids in their youth following third molar extraction. This use of prescription opioids has been associated with an increased risk of opioid misuse into adulthood. These trends in early adulthood and case reports of pediatric deaths occurring following dental sedation procedures make clear the urgency to understand and implement best patient safety practices in the dental care of children. Yet, U.S. data on medication prescribing patterns of pediatric dentists, evidence-based prescribing and community dental providers' attitudes toward implementation of pediatric patient safety is scarce. Although efforts and resources exist to curtail overprescribing of opioids and best patient safety practices in pediatric sedation, most interventions are focused on physicians and advanced practice providers (i.e., nurse practitioners and physician assistants) and may fail in broader implementation to pediatric dental practices. The objective of this mixedmethods study is to improve high-risk pediatric prescribing patterns among dentists by identifying current prescribing patterns associated with poor health outcomes that could be targeted for intervention. To accomplish this objective we aim to:  determine the extent to which high-risk medications are prescribed to pediatric dental patients and rates of poor patient outcomes in a population-based sample of commerciallyand publicly-insured children;  [Examine] dentists' attitudes towards medication safety when prescribing highrisk medications and decision-making when prescribing high-risk medications for pediatric patients; and  [Develop and pilot a checklist to facilitate treatment decisions that best promotion medication safety in pediatric dental care].

Approximately one in six children have a professionally diagnosed mental health disorder, which can lead to increased risk of suicide, worse health outcomes later in adulthood, and worse performance in school. However, approximately half of children with mental health disorders do not receive treatment, and Black, Hispanic, and low-income children, are less likely to receive mental health care than their peers. Schools are one of the main places children readily access health services, including mental health care, and school mental health services are often provided by licensed school counselors. Recently, there has been a push to increase mental health services in schools and access to school counselors in particular. The proposed study will examine one of the largest policies to increase funding for and access to school counselors in middle and high schools. Specifically, we will study how California's 2006 Supplemental School Counseling Program (Supplemental School Counseling Program) impacted children's access to school counselors, self-reported mental health outcomes, and related health and well-being outcomes. The Supplemental School Counseling Program provided middle and high schools with funds to hire more certified counselors, with funding levels that varied based on school sizes. We are not aware of any study that has examined the causal impacts of this large-scale policy on the mental health and related health outcomes of California students, or any related research examining the causal effects of a counseling policy of this scope on children's health. We will leverage variation in funding levels over time and across schools in a simulated instruments and event study model to estimate the causal impacts of additional counselors hired through the Supplemental School Counseling Program on health outcomes. Using administrative education data on schools, students, and personnel from the California Department of Education, and self-reported measures of mental health, healthy behaviors, and health outcomes from the California Healthy Kids Survey, we will 1) document how expanded funding for school counselors impacted students' access to counseling, including the number of counselors hired and their education, experience, and demographics, 2) estimate the causal impact of expanded access to school counselors on students' health, including mental health, healthy behaviors, and well-being, and 3) examine how access to school counselors and their impacts on children's health vary by urbanicity, family income, student race/ethnicity, and age. This research will provide evidence on how expanding access to school counselors may improve children's mental health and how to effectively design related policies so that they impact the children most in need of these services. This is particularly important right now as places consider whether and how to use COVID relief funding to hire more counselors, and people seek ways to address the current national child and adolescent mental health emergency.",5,5R03MH132119-02,PA-20-200,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,6,5,3,2

Impairments in navigation are particularly evident for those with mild cognitive impairment, a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's related dementia (and Alzheimer's related dementia). Yet, our understanding of age-related differences in navigation remains underdeveloped. The dominant explanation for age-related differences in navigation relates to impairments in the cognitive map, yet the explanatory capabilities of this model are limited, particularly in explaining the heterogeneity of age-related differences in navigation. Here, we seek to develop a novel computational model that employs an approximate Bayesian framework to better account for age-related differences in navigation. We focus in particular on testing hypotheses related to greater reliance on multimodal cue integration (Aim 1) and strategy rigidity (Aim 2) in older adults. These ideas will be tested using highly immersive virtual reality in which participants don a head-mounted display and free ambulate hallways. The experiment in Aim 1 will provide critical tests of our computational model by employing conditions involving both matching and mismatching visual and idiothetic (body-based) cues. This will allow us to test Aim 1 and whether older adults rely on multimodal integration to a greater extent than younger adults. The experiment in Aim 2 will test whether older adults rely on previous trials to a greater extent than younger adults, particularly for matching and mismatching trials. This will allow us to test the extent to which older adults might show strategy rigidity by overrelying on past trials. Aim 1&2 will also allow us to test ideas related to individual differences in navigation strategies, which can be assessed based on the variability in subject responses within the different conditions tested. Finally, we will test a subset of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment) to provide initial and exploratory testing of their navigational deficits in our experiments.

Very recently PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were approved by FDA for the treatment of patients with metastatic bladder cancer, but worked in only a subset of ~15-25% of patients. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop new and effective treatment for bladder cancer. Developing novel checkpoint inhibitors, especially inhibitors that target outside the PD1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways, is a promising strategy and may potentially have high impact in clinical management of human bladder cancer. Our central hypothesis of this proposal is that KIR3DL3-HHLA2 is a previously unrecognized immunosuppressive pathway as well as a novel therapeutic target in human bladder cancer. Guided by our published clinical and basic research and our strong preliminary data, we will pursue following specific aims: 1) Investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of HHLA2 expression in human bladder cancer and APCs; 2) Dissect co-inhibitory function and signaling of the KIR3DL3-HHLA2 pathway; and 3) Develop new immunotherapies against human bladder cancer by targeting the KIR3DL3-HHLA2 pathway.

The status quo in drug discovery is to acquire a large number of building blocks and stitch them together using a small number of reactions. Common building block pairs are classically matched to reactions through pattern recognition - the amide coupling is used for amines and carboxylic acids, the Suzuki coupling is used for bromides and boronates. In this established paradigm, building blocks are the source of diversity. The success of this classic approach relies on the commercial availability of the building blocks, and best introduces diversity around the periphery of the molecule. Here, we explore a new paradigm, where a small number of building blocks are stitched together using a large number of reactions. In this new paradigm, the reacting atoms are the source of diversity, complementing the classic approach. In the classic approach, an amine and carboxylic acid building block would be united by the amide coupling. We explore the theoretical and experimental development of amine-acid coupling reactions that are distinct from the amide coupling. We focus on new amine-acid coupling reactions that forge carbon-carbon bonds. The popularity of C-C bonds in pharmaceuticals and natural products suggests a necessity for new C-C bond-forming reactions. A key innovation is the use of chemoinformatics to demonstrate that amines and acids are available in high chemical diversity, typically more cost effective than organometal and organohalide building blocks and generally safe and stable to handle. Leveraging high-throughput experimentation to identify specific combinations of catalysts and ligands, we find that we are able to discover amine-acid C-C coupling reactions. The advent of our new amineacid C-C coupling reactions allows for building block repurposing of the two most abundantly available building blocks - amines and acids - for the synthesis of the most popular atom arrangements - C-C bonds - found in drugs. Achieving these novel amine-acid C-C couplings requires identification and optimization of new catalyst and reagent systems that enable broad substrate scope, user-friendliness, and potentially introduction of asymmetry. Using modern high-throughput techniques, we search for such reaction conditions in the hopes of inventing new and impactful amine-acid coupling reactions. While C-C bonds are an area of focus, other complexity generating reactions are also considered, along with amine-acid C-N and C-O couplings. We showcase the significance of our approach in drug discovery through the late-stage diversification of complex pharmaceuticals, and through the synthesis of diverse chemical libraries.",5,5R01GM144471-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

Multi-scale molecular simulations are vital to scientific research, impacting protein and nucleic acid engineering, biomaterials design, and drug discovery. AMBER, a simulation package with broad academic and industrial appeal since the 1980s, supports over 30,000 users across the world today. AMBER's enduring popularity owes to its pmemd.cuda simulation engine, optimally implemented affordable Graphics Processing Unit (Graphics Processing Unit) platforms. Recently, the implementation was extended with modern free energy methods and novel sampling algorithms to support a range of scientific applications, chief among them drug discovery by prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities. A new generation of integrated methods, workflows, and physical models are emerging, supported by a constellation of simulation software that includes NAMD, CHARMM, Gromacs, OpenMM, and other programs. With these scientific advances a critical barrier to progress in the field is the lack of a software package with seamless incorporation of high-performance MD, free energy estimators, and emerging models. To surmount this barrier and in responding to NIH Focused Technology Funding Opportunity which calls for innovative, focused technology development of a working prototype of critical research tools, we propose to develop a next-generation executing environment. The proposed work will offer fast prototyping, accessibility to new algorithms, further improvements in single-Graphics Processing Unit performance, strong scaling in synchronous and asynchronous ensemble methods, and interoperability with different types of force fields and physical models. We propose to do the following: 1. Environment: A Python-based executing environment for integrating various modules, including the MD engine, the free energy module, and user-workflow control. This essential fabric for linking runtime objects will create a foundation for connecting the molecular dynamics, model building, and analysis components, and is ready for future growth of scientific and algorithmic advances. 2. Optimization: New MD and free energy modules consisting of OOP CPU layers and high performance computing (high performance computing) kernels, collectively optimized by runtime managing mechanisms. Tight coupling of the C++ layer and the high performance computing kernel extensions constitutes a system that optimizes performance on both the host and high performance computing device. The goal is a set of efficient, robust, and extensible core simulation modules optimized at both individual module level and their collectively execution. 3. Application: A suite for automatic deduction of alchemical graphs. This facility, built in the new Python environment, will muster the new MD engine and integrated capabilities to showcase their scaling and versatility. It will also serve as an example to future developers of how to recombine the building blocks for advancing their own science.",5,5R01GM149874-02,PAR-22-127,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

The thymus is a critical site for the development and education of T cell to promote tolerance to self and thus prevent autoimmune diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes or multiple sclerosis. Within the thymus, the Autoimmune Regulator (Autoimmune Regulator) gene is a key player in the maintenance of immune tolerance as evident by its identification as the defective gene in the human autoimmune syndrome Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 1. Autoimmune Regulator acts within specialized medullary thymic epithelial cells (medullary thymic epithelial cells) to promote the expression of hundreds of self-antigens for the purpose of removing developing self-reactive T cells in a process known as negative selection. Recently however, we have uncovered new populations of medullary thymic epithelial cells that develop from cells that formerly expressed Autoimmune Regulator that we have termed post-Autoimmune Regulator-expressing (postAutoimmune Regulator) cells. These cells appear to fall into 2 subsets:  a keratinocyte-like cell that is associated with Hassall's corpuscles and  a tuft-like cell similar to specialized intestinal tuft cells. These cells show distinct patterns of gene expression with intermediate levels of self-antigen expression compared to conventional medullary thymic epithelial cells, suggesting that they may play a distinct and complementary role in mediating T cell tolerance in the thymus. We have developed a powerful set of genetic tools and mouse reporter lines that allows us to mark, follow and purify these unique cells in order to study their function in the thymus and their contribution to immune tolerance. We hypothesize that post-Autoimmune Regulator cells in the thymus represent a unique subset of thymic epithelial cells that mediate the maturation and development of tolerogenic T cell populations. Therefore, we propose to test this hypothesis through the following specific aims:  Define markers of cell identity and key pathways of cell development in thymic tuft cells,  Examine the effect of post-Autoimmune Regulator mTEC's on T cell selection and thymocyte development, and  Assess the contributions of post-Autoimmune Regulator medullary thymic epithelial cells to immune tolerance in vivo. These studies will allow us to uncover the development and function of these novel cells within the thymus as well as their contribution to T cell selection and maturation as well as induction of other important immune regulators, such as T regulatory and invariant natural killer cells. In this way, we hope to understand the role of these cells in the promoting immune tolerance and how they may be employed in the prevention of autoimmune disease.",5,5R37AI097457-13,PAS-15-055,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,3,4,1,3

Breakdown of this immune tolerance can give rise to autoimmune disease, and hence multiple mechanisms are in place to ensure immune self-tolerance. The thymus is a critical site for the development and education of T cells to promote tolerance to self through expression of tissue specific antigens (tissue specific antigens) by specialized medullary thymic epithelial cells (medullary thymic epithelial cells). The transcriptional regulators Aire and Fezf2 are known to act within medullary thymic epithelial cells to promote the expression of thousands of TSA selfantigens for the purpose of removing developing self-reactive T cells in a process known as negative selection. Aire and Fezf2 are shown to be required for some, but not all TSA genes expressed in medullary thymic epithelial cells, suggesting additional transcriptional regulators are required for the full repertoire of the observed TSA expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells. Furthermore, recent work has highlighted the complexity of medullary thymic epithelial cells with at least four mTEC populations: Aire+ medullary thymic epithelial cells, Ccl21a medullary thymic epithelial cells, Late/Post Aire medullary thymic epithelial cells, and tuft cells. However, there is limited knowledge about the developmental regulation and progenitors of these heterogeneous mTEC subsets. We have identified the transcription factor Ikaros (Ikzf1) as a novel regulator of mTEC composition and function, with deletion of Ikaros in medullary thymic epithelial cells causing a reduction of Aire+ medullary thymic epithelial cells and an expansion of tuft cells. Moreover, Ikaros-deficient medullary thymic epithelial cells have a defect in TSA gene expression resulting in specific signs of autoimmunity. Interestingly, mutations in IKZF1 have been linked to human autoimmune diseases. Thus, we hypothesize a novel role for Ikaros in mTEC lineage development, TSA expression and central tolerance, and that defects in mTEC function could contribute to the autoimmunity seen in humans with IKZF1 mutations. We propose to test our hypothesis and increase our knowledge of this novel mTEC transcriptional regulator through the following specific aims:  Identify the stage(s) of mTEC development at which Ikaros modulates mTEC function,  Interrogate the molecular mechanism of Ikaros function in medullary thymic epithelial cells, and  Determine if TEC specific deletion of Ikaros affects T cell tolerance and autoimmunity. To complete these aims, we have developed a unique and powerful set of genetic tools and mouse reporter lines that allow us to perturb Ikaros function in medullary thymic epithelial cells. We will use flow cytometry to investigate mTEC and thymic immune cell phenotypes, combined scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq to analyze gene expression and chromatin accessibility, and supplement with mechanistic studies in vitro in cell lines. Our long-term goal is to increase our understanding of the regulation of mTEC development and function in central tolerance, and how alterations can lead to a break of tolerance and autoimmunity.",5,5R01AI165829-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,3,4,1,3

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (Cancer-associated fibroblasts) have emerged as potential targets for reprogramming the tumor microenvironment and for optimizing therapeutic strategies. However, there is a critical gap in research targeting tumors and Cancer-associated fibroblasts simultaneously. Breast cancer tumors have distinct subtypes. And there is a lack of a biochemical marker exclusive to Cancer-associated fibroblasts because of their heterogeneity. In fact, the currently available CAFtargeted therapies succumb to off-target effects, so their applications are limited. We aim to address this conundrum by testing our central hypothesis that factors secreted from non-cancer-associated fibroblasts' biochemical and physical properties that express CD36-a cell surface receptor downregulated in Cancer-associated fibroblasts-could be utilized as an alternative strategy to induce growth suppression in subtypes of breast cancer while upregulating CD36 in Cancer-associated fibroblasts. This hypothesis is based on our pilot study showing that co-transplantation of breast cancer cells with CD36+ fibroblasts' biochemical and physical properties dramatically suppressed tumor growth in animals. Furthermore, for the first time, we identified three active protein ligands in the secretome of CD36+ fibroblasts' biochemical and physical properties and determined the effective concentration of their corresponding recombinant proteins that induce growth suppression in breast cancer cell lines while overexpressing CD36 in at least one CAF model. This study is significant because it will have a positive translational impact on breast cancer therapy with reduced toxicity. We will continue to test our hypothesis through two specific aims and the integration of a novel technological platform: Aim 1a will identify breast cancer subtypes that are sensitive to the three recombinant proteins (recombinant proteins). To this end, we will employ 3D cultures of the established cell lines and patient-derived organoids. We will also investigate the overexpression of CD36, by the active ligands, on a panel of Cancer-associated fibroblasts. To facilitate a large number of experimental variables and intrinsic heterogeneity of organoids, we will develop a novel high-throughput imaging and high-content screening by coupling printed 3D cultures or organoids with 3D microscopy and deep learning methods for quantitative profiling of 3D organization and molecular features. Aim 1b will determine the mechanisms by which the three recombinant proteins induce (a) growth suppression in sensitive breast cancer subtypes or (b) upregulate CD36 in Cancer-associated fibroblasts. Mechanistic studies will be anchored by apoptotic pathways, the cisregulatory networks' prediction, and the application of bioinformatics techniques. It will also include the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction induced by recombinant proteins. Aim 2 will use mouse models to investigate tumor suppression in sensitive cell lines, mouse tumors, and PDX models. Resected tumors will also be profiled for tumor morphology and molecular endpoints using advanced computational methods. In addition, in select cases, tumor sections will be complemented with spatial proteomics/transcriptomic for additional mechanistic studies. The study is innovative because it applies, for the first time, factors secreted from CD36+ fibroblasts' biochemical and physical properties that confer tumor suppression and could be utilized to treat subtypes of breast cancer with few side effects.",5,5R01CA279408-02,PAR-22-099,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Newer all oral bedaquiline-containing Rifampin-resistant tuberculosis regimens, now recommended worldwide, will shorten treatment and improve outcomes. However, the lack of timely drug susceptibility data due to the slow growth rate of M. tuberculosis and the need for high containment biological laboratories are major barriers to scale-up of bedaquiline and other new and repurposed drugs. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and other commercial molecular TB tests can identify rifampin resistance, but cannot inform complete treatment regimens because they are limited to analyzing only a small number of genetic loci (i.e., ""hot spots""). Targeted next-generation sequencing (next-generation sequencing) is able to sequence entire genes rapidly without need for culture, and therefore could transform Rifampin-resistant tuberculosis clinical management. Achieving near-patient clinical application, however, has two major bottlenecks:  a complex, unstandardized workflow for preparing clinical samples for next-generation sequencing, and  the cost and infrastructure requirements of industry-standard Illumina platforms. Partnering with global TB diagnostics leader Cepheid, we address these barriers by utilizing the ultrasonication, microfluidics, and thermocycler capabilities of the existing Xpert Ultra cartridge, already in use in over 180 countries, to unite a vetted direct-sample-to-answer system with a nanopore gene sequencing platform for the first time. Xpert CartSeq, a pioneering cartridgebased sequencing solution suitable for lower levels of healthcare, achieves robust DNA extraction and sophisticated library preparation while minimizing user variability and mitigating technical skill requirements.

These novel pouches are rapidly growing in popularity. For example, in 2020, dollar sales in U.S. convenience stores grew by 470% for 'Zyn', a leading brand of these pouches. Our preliminary research indicates that these products are being marketed heavily to consumers, often with advertising tactics that may convey modified risk (i.e., descriptors of ""tobacco-free""). These pouches contain non-tobacco flavors (e.g., fruit) with known appeal to youth. Tobacco industry research shows that these pouches deliver similar, or greater, levels of nicotine to users than traditional smokeless oral tobacco products, suggesting that they can produce dependence. Because FDA applies a public health standard when regulating tobacco products, the risks and benefits of novel oral nicotine pouches must be considered for current smokers (a population that may benefit from switching to novel nicotine pouches) and non-nicotine users, especially youth (a population for whom nicotine pouch use would have negative public health consequences). Using human lab studies, marketing surveillance, and web-based experiments, this innovative project will elucidate product features and marketing tactics that may drive initiation and continued use of novel oral nicotine pouches for smokers and non-nicotine users, including youth, addressing FDA CTP's areas of scientific interest in Addiction/Abuse Liability, Behavior, and Marketing Influences. In Aim 1, smokers will use pouches of different flavors (tobacco; mint; fruit) and nicotine doses (low; high), and their own brand of cigarettes, over 7 lab sessions and pharmacokinetic (pharmacokinetic) and pharmacodynamic (pharmacodynamic) effects (e.g., subjective abuse liability and tobacco withdrawal) will be assessed. In Aim 2, we will surveil advertisements for novel nicotine pouches over 5 years to identify/monitor marketing tactics and examine, via web-based experiments, how common tactics influence product perceptions (i.e., perceived harm, addictiveness, and appeal) and use intentions among cigarette smokers and youth non-nicotine users. In Aim 3, we will conduct a second lab study with smokers and adult non-nicotine users to determine how a common marketing tactic (e.g., ""tobacco-free"" descriptors) impacts use behaviors and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic effects of these pouches. This project will provide vital new data on product features and marketing tactics that may influence whether smokers and non-nicotine users (including youth) initiate, continue using, and possibly become addicted to novel oral nicotine pouches. This information will allow FDA to make informed decisions about what features should be allowable in novel nicotine pouches, how accessible they should be, and what marketing tactics should be permissible. Ultimately, this research can protect public health by informing polices to mitigate use of these pouches by nicotine-naïve youth as well as policies that may facilitate product switching for smokers.",5,5R01DA055962-03,RFA-OD-21-002,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,6,5,8,2

Despite the advent of immunotherapy, especially checkpoint inhibitor antibodies (antibodies), advanced melanoma remains a progressive and incurable disease for most patients. There is an urgent need for new melanoma therapies. Autologous melanoma vaccines that use endogenous anti-a-Gal antibodies (antibodies) (present in all human serum) as adjuvants to enhance the immunogenicity of poorly immunogenic tumor-specific antigens (tumor-specific antigens) of melanoma have been explored but were only partially successful. In a different context, anti-a-Gal antibodies play a critical role in the rapid rejection of xenografts, e.g., a pig kidney transplanted into a human recipient. The so called hyperacute rejection of the xenograft occurs within minutes to hours due to the fact that pig cells express large amounts of a-Gal, which are foreign to humans, and are recognized by human anti-a-Gal antibodies. Opsonization of the pig cells with the antibodies leads to their destruction primarily by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (complement-dependent cytotoxicity), but also Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity), and Ab-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (Ab-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis). Similarly, the anti-a-Gal antibodies present in Chagas disease patients kill the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi that causes this disease. T. cruzi expresses large amounts of a-Gal epitopes, one prominent being Gala1,3Galb1,4GlcNAc (Gala1,3Galb1,4GlcNAc), on its cell surface, and the patient's anti-a-Gal antibodies lyse the parasite within minutes by complement-dependent and independent mechanisms. If cancer cells could be made to express a-Gal on their cell surface, the patient's own already existing anti-a-Gal antibodies could target and destroy them by complement-dependent cytotoxicity, Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and Ab-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis. The destruction of glycoengineered a-Gal expressing melanoma cells by complement-dependent cytotoxicity in the presence of anti-a-Gal antibodies and complement has already been demonstrated in vitro but has never been explored in vivo. Here we propose a novel melanoma gene therapy in the a1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout mouse model, in which melanoma cells are selectively transfected in vivo with a gene coding for a1,3-galactosyl transferase (a1,3-galactosyl transferase). This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of terminal Gala1,3Galb1,4GlcNAc residues on glycoproteins. Based on recent advances in nanotechnology, we propose to use functionalized lipid nanoparticles (lipid nanoparticles) as delivery vehicle for the transfection. The lipid nanoparticles have a DT7 peptide and folate on their surface that target the receptors TfR1 and FRa overexpressed in melanoma (and other cancers). These receptors can internalize the LNP by an active transport, thus delivering the gene. The transcription is under the control of a melanocytespecific promoter, which adds another level of selectivity for targeting melanoma. Not all melanoma cells need to be transfected, as the adaptive immune system would also be activated resulting in specific anti-tumor immunity. This novel a-Gal based gene therapy could result in the rapid destruction of melanoma cells and antitumor immunity in vivo.",1,1R21CA283583-01A1,PAR-22-086,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Although many of the biological functions of long non-coding RNAs have been recognized, it is unclear whether and how long non-coding RNAs can regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters and if so, whether the regulations are implicated in cancer chemo-resistance.

Deaths will result from complex and combined organ injuries that occur in a timeand dose-dependent manner. While the strategic national stockpile includes agents for hematological acute radiation syndrome (hematological acute radiation syndrome), no candidates are approved for gastrointestinal ARS (gastrointestinal ARS) and few if any candidates are approved for other organs. As cutaneous radiation injury [CRI (blistering, bleeding)] when combined with H/gastrointestinal ARS can lead to death, an agent that aids multiple epithelial tissues for combined injuries would be an ideal medical countermeasure. In light of the far-reaching potential of FGFs, we developed an FGF-2 peptide mimetic, FGF-PT; this alternative to the full-length protein is economical, easily scaled and synthesized, and has a long storage life. We hypothesize that the pluripotent effects of FGF-PT on epithelial, mesenchymal, and endothelial cells, which include preservation and proliferation of progenitor cells, maintenance of normal cellular maturation and function, and improved tissue perfusion, will mitigate combined radiation injury syndromes. We propose to test this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: We will move FGF-PT toward an investigational new drug (investigational new drug) application for gastrointestinal ARS. We have already discussed the pre-investigational new drug process with representatives of NIAID, FDA, and BARDA. Based on this meeting, we propose a 6-step process to confirm mitigation benefit and mechanism of action in a gastrointestinal ARS/HARS model in Wistar Rats. Studies will include pharmacokinetics (pharmacokinetics), pharmacodynamics (pharmacodynamics), and toxicity testing in rats followed by pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in Rhesus macaques to determine the drug dose and schedule for full good laboratory practice (good laboratory practice) testing in rats and macaques in separate follow-up studies. Aim 2: We have shown that FGFs can mitigate radiation dermatitis and improve platelet function following irradiation. In this aim, we will elucidate the role of both systemic and topical FGF-PT for CRI using an NIH Swiss model (strontium-90 beta burn) and Göttingen minipig model. In the minipig, we will test our models for allometric scaling between mouse, rat, monkey, and pig, and employ a radiation burn healing model (16 sites of 4x4 cm /minipig) developed by Core B.

Funding for that study will be sought in Year 4. Near the completion of Year 4, we expect to have similar evidence for CRI.

Both serve as critical tumor-suppressors, but the pathways governing them are distinct. Replicative senescence is triggered by short functional telomeres, dependent on the p53/pRB tumor suppressor pathways and characterized by permanent cell cycle arrest and continued metabolism. When p53/pRB pathways are dysfunctional, senescence entry is compromised, and cells continue to proliferate until their telomeres become dysfunctional and chromosome fusions arise. This triggers replicative crisis, a p53/pRB-independent state, where the vast majority of cells rapidly succumb to cell death. However, rare cells can even overcome this barrier and become neoplastic, pointing to replicative crisis as one of the final barriers against age-associated tumor cell initiation. Recently, it was discovered that cell death in crisis is governed by macroautophagy through a pathway in which cytoplasmic DNA species from fused and broken chromosomes activate the cGAS-STING cytoplasmic DNA-sensing response that normally detects viral DNA. Suppression of autophagy allowed cells to bypass crisis and continue to proliferate, while accumulating genome instability. This discovery represented the first crisis-bypass system, which allowed the design of a CRISPR suppression screen aimed at identifying factors required to protect cells against age-associated cancer initiation. Another nucleic acid sensor, ZBP1 emerged as critical for the crisis program, which was confirmed by ZBP1 suppression allowing cells to proliferate beyond crisis. Here, in three synergistic aims it is proposed to decipher the mechanism underlying the ZBP1-dependent inhibition of cancer initiation. AIM1 will determine the interactions between dysfunctional telomeres, telomeric (TERRA) transcripts and ZBP1 and define the mechanisms of ZBP1-mediated innate immune signaling on mitochondria during crisis. AIM2 is designed to investigate the mechanism of the mitochondrial localization of the crisis-specific isoform of ZBP1 and its relevant interacting partners. Finally, the ability to allow cells to proliferate beyond crisis revealed the existence of a third previously unknown proliferative barrier against cancer initiation (called M3), which will be extensively characterized in AIM 3. Successful completion of these aims will shed new light on crosstalk between telomeres, mitochondria and inflammation (three established hallmarks of aging), the role of a telomere-to-mitochondria innate immune signaling pathway in the prevention of age-associated cancer and establish biomarkers and new approaches to understand the relevance of the new M3 proliferative barrier as tumor-suppressor.",5,5R01AG077324-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,10,10,2,4

Successful monoclonal antibody (monoclonal antibody) prophylaxis aims to offer an alternative to vaccine development efforts, and the relatively long half-lives and tolerability profiles of broadly neutralizing antibodies promise to offer a complement to the small-molecule inhibitors comprising current pre-exposure prophylaxis (pre-exposure prophylaxis) options. While broadly neutralizing antibodies represent a promising approach to provide protection from infection, suppress plasma and tissue viremia, and reduce viral reservoirs, results from the first major bNAb prevention efficacy trial were mixed. Protection against infection with neutralization susceptible strains was observed, but fewer strains were sufficiently susceptible than anticipated, and overall efficacy criteria were not met. Our objective is to define and refine the means by which broadly neutralizing antibodies can be used to restrict HIV replication in vivo using a more stringent model in which their ability to delay or prevent systemic viremia in the context of seeded HIV infection is monitored. We hypothesize that the antiviral activity afforded by a single bNAb can be enhanced by one or more of two distinct strategies that will be rigorously tested for in vivo antiviral activity by benchmarking their ability to delay detectable plasma viremia in the context of spreading infection. Guided by strong preliminary data, the project goals will be achieved though completion of two Specific Aims: 1) Define the ability of Fc engineering to improve bNAb antiviral activity across diverse envelope epitopes, 2) Define the ability of bNAb combinations, with and without Fc engineering to improve bNAb antiviral activity. Each strategy will be evaluated for effects on neutralization and effector function in vitro and in vivo for the ability to delay or prevent systemic viremia. Collectively, these studies will generate unprecedented insights into the means whereby broadly neutralizing antibodies, if introduced in early infection after mucosal exposure, delay or restrict viral spread thereby lowering the viral burden and improving outcomes. This work will inform on both next-generation rational vaccine design and the ongoing deployment of bNAb prophylaxis and therapy-driving innovation relevant to combatting HIV acquisition and transmission across diverse intervention strategies and populations.",1,1R01AI183970-01,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

Previous work has suggested a role for divergent levels of sex hormones as an underlying cause. In particular, increased androgen signaling drives expression of the transcription factor TCF7, which dampens conversion of CD8+ T cell progenitor to effector cells. The resultant decrease in the pool of effectors, the cell type mediating direct destruction of endocrine tissues, protects from endocrine autoimmunity. Our recent data point to an additional role for increased X chromosome copy number in female sex bias, since deficiency of the X-linked gene UTX also suppresses progenitor to effector conversion. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that sex differences in human autoimmune endocrinopathies is driven by both increased X-linked UTX expression and lower androgen levels in females. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of the X-linked genes promoting progenitor to effector conversion. We will utilize virally-mediated UTX overexpression to determine the effects of this X-linked gene in effector differentiation. Additionally, we will query effector differentiation in CD8+ T cells from patients with Klinefelter Syndrome, a condition in which phenotypic males have an extra X chromosome (47XXY). In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of androgen and estrogen signaling on TCF7 expression and progenitor to effector conversion.

Unfortunately, such therapies currently lack proper delivery mechanisms, precluding their widespread applicability. Selfassembled deoxyribonucleic acid (deoxyribonucleic acid) nanoparticles have shown potential as minimally cytotoxic therapeutic carriers in cancerous and other in vitro and in vivo models. While evidence suggests that deoxyribonucleic acid nanoparticles-based drug carriers can be taken up by mammalian cells via endocytosis, it is unknown how these deoxyribonucleic acid nanoparticles can overcome the fate of endocytosis-triggered degradation to reach the cytosol and, once there, can controllably maintain stability. With the enabling science explaining their behavior and mechanisms of controlling their stability in the cell cytosol it will be possible to make bold advances in engineering therapeutic delivery systems. To that end, the proposed work has two overarching scientific payoffs. Payoff 1, induce endosomal escape and enhanced cytosolic accessibility of deoxyribonucleic acid nanoparticles by the integration of calcium in their assembly process. Payoff 2, identify the rate of breakdown and mechanisms of stabilization of deoxyribonucleic acid nanoparticles in different types of cell cytosols. Innovative technologies will be the foci of the PI's training program and will be implemented to achieve the project goals, namely, multi-step Förster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy for high-resolution tracking of deoxyribonucleic acid nanoparticle inside the cell and in vitro cell microinjections enabling study of these nanoparticles directly in the cytosolic environment. First, a deoxyribonucleic acid origami based nanotube will be tested for structural stability in calcium-supplemented buffer. Thereafter, the nanotube will be used as a carrier for the delivery of functional RNA molecules to representative fluorescent protein-expressing cells and checked for its cytosolic reachability and efficacy in protein regulation after undergoing endocytosis. Second, small (20 nm) deoxyribonucleic acid nanoparticles with branched architecture and non-canonical nucleic acids will be embedded with multi-step FRET reporters for measuring structural integrity. These deoxyribonucleic acid nanoparticles will be microinjected into live cells cytosolic region and their breakage be determined. Last, the cytosolic stability of these deoxyribonucleic acid nanoparticles will be correlated with different types of mammalian cells with known cytosolic variability (tumor, immune, and other cell types) in order to map the role of structurally diverse deoxyribonucleic acid nanoparticles in targeting cells with different physiologies. The PI will also receive training in rigorous analysis of in vitro research, lab management, and the prolific grant writing process, which will facilitate their transition to an independent research program.

These cyclic patterns are important for functions including growth, reproduction, glucose control, excitation, and rest. However, these dynamic processes are rarely reproduced in cell culture, meaning that we often study cells out of their natural environment. Thus, the biology that we observe in the laboratory can be incomplete or different from in our bodies. This severely handicaps our understanding of disease and our search for effective therapies. This project aims to build a cheap and easy to use cell culture device that reproduces the hormonal cycles present in our bodies. Furthermore, the system monitors the response of cells to these hormonal pulses, sampling rapidly to capture quickly changing behavior. The system is built to resemble a conventional cell culture plate, making it familiar to all biologists. However, inside the plate are hidden pumps, channels, and even simple computing circuits that allow culture media to be automatically cycled between different formulations, or sampled out into collection wells.

This calls for neurotechnologies that allow for large-scale recording of neuro-activity across tissue depths and brain regions at physiological timescales and cellular resolution in awake and behaving animals. While recent advancements in optical tool development based on the combination of two-photon scanning fluorescence microscopy (2p M) and genetically-encoded calcium indicators (genetically-encoded calcium indicators) as reporters of neuro-activity have been aimed at addressing these needs by developing faster, larger-scale, and volumetric calcium (Ca2+) imaging technologies, a fundamental unsolved challenge in this context is navigating the inherent tradeoffs between speed, resolution, and the size of the recording volume in a principled and scalable manner. Our lab has recently established criteria for such optimal recording schemes which has led to the realization of a new high-speed volumetric Ca2+ imaging approach termed Light Beads Microscopy (Light Beads Microscopy). Through Light Beads Microscopy, we have demonstrated fluorescence lifetime limited volumetric recording of neuro-activity at a single-cell resolution of up to 1 million neurons within both cortical hemispheres of awake, behaving mice. In this project, we will pursue a multipronged strategy towards the optimization, biological applications, and effective dissemination of our Light Beads Microscopy technology while extending its performance. This will result in a more robust, less complex, and more user-friendly version of our Light Beads Microscopy technology. To enable its broad and effective dissemination, in the second part of the project, we will utilize feedback from our α-testers to design, build, and disseminate β-prototypes of our system that will be distributed to several end-user laboratories who will be testing and applying our Light Beads Microscopy technology in the context of their biological questions.

In mice, FOXOs are central regulators of stem cell homeostasis during aging and are critical for tissue integrity. In humans, SNPs in the FOXO3 locus have been linked to longevity, and the upstream regulator of FOXO's, insulin/IGF signaling must be tightly regulated to preserve healthy aging. Yet, we still lack an understanding of how FOXOs function at the chromatin level, and how their activity is altered during aging and in the context of neurodegeneration. In preliminary work, we identified for the first time the direct network of FOXO3 targets in human cells, and found that FOXOs function as pioneer factors to deploy a secondary network of transcriptional regulators to extend their target gene network. Here, we will address this critical question of the mechanisms underlying the pioneer activity, its heterogeneous nature, and how it changes in the context of aging and Alzheimer's Disease.

In some cases, the primary tumor is too small to be detected, with enlarged nodes being the only manifestation of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer. These unknown primary cancers (unknown primary cancers), often induced by human papilloma virus (human papilloma virus), usually arise in the mucosa of Waldeyer's ring, the lymphatic tonsillar tissues of the pharynx. Finding UPC is significant and impactful addressing an unmet need with long term oncologic and functional outcomes improved by locating and removing UPC. However, their detection is impaired by the corrugated, cryptic surface, and nodularity of lymphatic tissue which decreases the sensitivity of physical examination while the vascularity and fluorodeoxyglucose (fluorodeoxyglucose) avidity of the lymphoid tissue obscure small tumors by computerized tomography (computerized tomography) and positron emission tomography (positron emission tomography).

Recent advances in treatment for aquaporin-4 NMOSD have improved its prognosis but are associated with increased risk of serious infections. As an autoimmune neurological illness with a well-defined autoantigen, aquaporin-4 NMOSD should be amenable to a cure by antigen-specific ablation or tolerization. However, preclinical testing of antigen-specific tolerizing therapy for aquaporin-4 NMOSD remains hampered by the lack of an animal model that recapitulates the autoimmunity and the pathology in the same animal. Current animal models of aquaporin-4 NMOSD require adoptive transfer which introduces confounding variables that are difficult to resolve. The objective of this proposal is to develop a model that recapitulates the autoimmunity and the pathology of aquaporin-4 NMOSD in the same animal and thereby develop an animal model suitable for preclinical testing of antigen-specific tolerization therapies. Aim 1.1 will establish anti-aquaporin-4 autoimmunity in the aquaporin-4 null (aquaporin-4.lacZ) mouse.

However, CTSA researchers do not have ready access to a definitive and representative reference dataset linking the genome to diagnosis, clinical progression, therapeutic response, and precision-adjusted laboratory reference ranges with the appropriate consents to recontact patients if needed. In preliminary work, three of the leading children's hospitals in the CTSA program formed the Genomics Research and Innovation Network (Genomics Research and Innovation Network) leveraging a combined, ethnically diverse population with unparalleled representation across the pediatric disease spectrum. Genomics Research and Innovation Network sites broadly consent patients into compatible biobanking protocols.

This approach has been successful in some hematological malignancies, however, it has not been successful to date in solid tumors including small cell lung cancer (small cell lung cancer). Two mechanisms by which small cell lung cancer may evade T cell-mediated killing are loss of expression of antigens, and suppression of T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. In this proposal, we will attempt to overcome these barriers by designing CAR T cells that target two small cell lung cancer antigens simultaneously, and that produce multiple factors (""armors"") that enhance T cell activity in solid tumors. We hypothesize that these dual-armored, dual targeted (dual-armored, dual targeted) CAR T cells will be more effective against small cell lung cancer than previous T cell-mediated and immune therapies. We have previously shown that CAR T cells targeted to either the antigen GD3 or to the antigen DLL3, both of which are expressed on the majority of small cell lung cancers, are capable of killing small cell lung cancer cells in preclinical systems. Additionally, we have developed multiple armored CAR T cells that secrete factors such as IL-18, or an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that blocks the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, or an scFv blocking the phagocytosis-inhibitory signal CD47 on tumor cells. All of these armors enhance CAR T cell activity in our in vivo model systems through different mechanisms. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will generate CAR T cells targeting DLL3 and GD3 simultaneously, to overcome antigen heterogeneity and antigen loss in tumors as a means of escape from T cell-mediated killing. Simultaneously, in Aim 2, we will test pairs of armors to identify the pair that is the most effective at enhancing the activity of single antigen-targeted CAR T cells against small cell lung cancer in vivo in immunocompetent systems. We then analyze the immune cells in the small cell lung cancer tumor microenvironment following CAR T cell treatment to assess changes mediated by the armored CAR T cells. Ultimately, in Aim 3, we will combine these approaches to generate CAR T cells that recognize GD3 and DLL3 and produce multiple armors. These dual-armored, dual targeted CAR T cells for small cell lung cancer may be suitable for further preclinical testing in preparation for clinical trials beyond the scope of this proposal, representing a novel therapeutic approach to small cell lung cancer. Given our robust track record in CAR T cell clinical translation, we fully anticipate having new CAR T cells suitable for clinical trials at the conclusion of funding. Additionally, these novel CAR T cells may be used as tools to explore the interactions between T cells and the small cell lung cancer microenvironment.

Provision of sterile syringes (via syringe service programs [SSPs] and pharmacies) helps prevent injectionrelated HIV transmission; however, syringe access is insufficient in many locations, and the majority of people who inject drugs experience substantial overlapping sexual and injection-related HIV risks. As in several geographic regions of the United States, in the Northeast, increasing injection of opioids, stimulants, and other drugs is causing renewed concerns about HIV transmission, with CDC declaring HIV outbreaks connected to injection drug use. Despite the proven efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (pre-exposure prophylaxis) and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation that pre-exposure prophylaxis be offered to people who inject drugs at risk for HIV acquisition, uptake in this socially marginalized population remains severely limited. Overview of Proposal: The current proposal is a culmination of extensive preliminary research, including (a) in-depth qualitative research with people who inject drugs across Northeastern communities affected by opioid use and HIV that documented high HIV risk and low pre-exposure prophylaxis knowledge but high interest, (b) key informant interviews with pre-exposure prophylaxis providers, SSP staff, and other key stakeholders who provided specific suggestions for pre-exposure prophylaxis intervention content and delivery strategies, and (c) two pilot randomized controlled trials (randomized controlled trials) of pre-exposure prophylaxis Navigator-delivered behavioral interventions with high risk populations including people who use drugs and people who inject drugs that demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of our proposed approach. This extensive research has led to the development of the ""pre-exposure prophylaxis for Health"" intervention. Conceptual Model: ""pre-exposure prophylaxis for Health"" is a brief, multi-component behavioral intervention delivered to people who inject drugs by highly trained pre-exposure prophylaxis Navigators embedded within SSPs that seeks to improve pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake (primary outcome) and pre-exposure prophylaxis adherence and persistence (secondary outcomes) among people who inject drugs by increasing HIV and pre-exposure prophylaxis knowledge, improving HIV risk perceptions and pre-exposure prophylaxis interest and motivation, cultivating pre-exposure prophylaxis use self-efficacy and behavioral skills, and reducing structural barriers to pre-exposure prophylaxis use. Overview of Study Design: We propose testing efficacy of ""pre-exposure prophylaxis for Health"" in two SSPs in Lawrence and Boston/Cambridge, Massachusetts, areas heavily affected by injection-related HIV transmission. We will equally randomize 200 people who inject drugs to receive either (a) the ""pre-exposure prophylaxis for Health"" intervention, which includes Navigator-delivered, theory-informed HIV and pre-exposure prophylaxis education, motivational interviewing, problem-solving and planning, and ongoing pre-exposure prophylaxis navigation (n=100), or (b) standard of care (information and referrals; n=100). We will evaluate successful pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake (via medical/pharmacy records), adherence (via drug levels in hair), and persistence (via medical/ pharmacy records) over 12 months. We will also examine the degree to which intervention efficacy occurs through specific conceptual mediators (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis knowledge, motivation, self-efficacy) and differs according to hypothesized moderators (e.g., age, gender, sexual risk).",5,5R01DA051849-05,RFA-DA-20-013,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,6,5,3,2

Interpretation of how these variants cause diseases and understanding the mechanism(s) of their statistical associations to phenotype are crucial problems in computational biology and genetics. The problems are not straightforward to address because over 90% of disease-associated variants are in non-coding regions that have highly specific cellular context regulatory functions and about which we have limited comprehension. The long-term goal of this project is to explain mechanistically how non-coding genetic variants affect cellular context-dependent gene regulatory networks and influence phenotypes. Expression quantitative trait locus (Expression quantitative trait locus) mapping and Gene regulatory networks (Gene regulatory networks) are two common approaches for interpreting regulatory mechanisms of genetic variants. Expression quantitative trait locus mapping connects variants in non-coding regions to genes by a population-based association study. Gene regulatory networks provide information on the cis-regulatory elements that control context-specific expression of target genes, and information about the transcription factors that act on these elements. GRN-based variant interpretation is complementary to Expression quantitative trait locus mapping and has the potential to overcome the limitations of Expression quantitative trait locus mapping, which are:  Expression quantitative trait locus mapping is biased for common alleles;  Expression quantitative trait locus mapping cannot distinguish variants in strong linkage disequilibrium; and  the power to detect trans-Expression quantitative trait locus is low. Most previous regulatory analysis research based on ENCODE data did not include personal genotyping data, and most Expression quantitative trait locus mapping research did not include regulatory information. Joint modelling of Expression quantitative trait locuss and Gene regulatory networks would enable high-accuracy and mechanistic variant interpretation. However, the required dataset for such analysis - matched gene expression, epigenome, and genotyping data from the same individuals - are not available for a large human sample. Available datasets are cross-individual paired genotyping and gene expression data, such as GTEx data, and cross-cellular-contexts paired gene expression and epigenomics data, such as ENCODE data. These two types of paired data are also available at the single cell level. To achieve our long-term goal, we will develop statistical methods to integrate these unmatched datasets (either bulk or single cell) from different sources to  infer high accuracy context-specific Gene regulatory networks to connect variants, transcription factors, cis-regulatory elements, and target genes; and  detect trans-Expression quantitative trait locuss that regulate target genes. These methods can be extended to interpret disease-associated variants, identify causal variants, and infer personalized drug response to provide guidance for precision medicine.

When the brain undergoes stress (e.g., ischemia, Alzheimer's related neurodegeneration, traumatic brain injury), heat shock proteins (heat shock proteins) are induced to assist in protein folding, degradation and other functions. heat shock proteins, also called chaperones, function to maintain cellular proteostasis through dynamic protein complexes called chaperomes to aid in protein folding, activation, degradation or disaggregation, molecular chaperoning and translocation in normal cells. These interactions aren't based on monomeric protein expression, but rather through the strength and number of interactions. Under conditions of cellular stress, the chaperomes become biochemically 'rewired' to form a network of pathologically stable, high-molecular-weight complexes, recently called the epichaperome. As critical hub proteins, heat shock protein 90 (heat shock protein 90) and heat-shock cognate 70 (heat-shock cognate 70) are the central proteins involved in the pathological formation of the epichaperome and are linked together by HSP-organizing protein (HSP-organizing protein). Once heat shock protein 90 and heat-shock cognate 70 are biochemically altered into the epichaperome epicenter, importantly, these proteins both lose their normal physiological function of proper protein production and also recruit a wide range of co-chaperones into the scaffold, perpetuating pathological progression. It has recently been demonstrated in Alzheimer's Disease and in various cancer models that the epichaperome is responsible for the disturbance of protein-protein interaction networks, which ultimately become dysfunctional and drive the pathological phenotype of the disease. It is currently unknown if traumatic brain injury results in the formation of epichaperome responses. Our preliminary data demonstrate that there is significantly increased high molecular weight expression of HSP-90 and HSC-70, indicative of increased assembly of the maladaptive epichaperome complex, in male and female rats at both acute and sub-acute time-points after controlled cortical impact (cortical impact). These epichaperome-mediated protein network changes have been identified and therapeutically targeted. PU-AD is an oral, brain-permeable epichaperome inhibitor, which targets the slow kinetics of heat shock protein 90 specifically within the epichaperome without altering monomeric heat shock protein 90 protein expression and normal function. Preliminary data indicate that systemic administration of PU-AD attenuates cognitive deficits after cortical impact. The overall goal of the project is to provide proof-of-principle that traumatic brain injury produces an epichaperome response and that disassembling the epichaperome via PU-AD improves learning and memory. The first aim will provide a comprehensive assessment of key chaperome components that participate in the formation of the epichaperome after traumatic brain injury across brain regions and time-points. The second aim will evaluate a dose response and treatment window of PU-AD in traumatic brain injury looking at epichaperome and neurobehavioral outcomes. Since PU-AD is approved for clinical trial for AD, a pathway for clinical translation exists for traumatic brain injury.",1,1R21NS133447-01A1,PA-21-219,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,2,6,6,1

Thus, in recent years several medical centers in the United States have implemented clinical pharmacogenomics services to support such policies. Among the services that can be supported, preemptive clinical genotyping services produce pharmacogenomic data before it is known that a particular drug may be needed by a patient. Preemptive clinical genotyping services that cover genetic markers primarily based on populations of European ancestry, however, can have reduced performance of a policy to identify well-tolerated medications in understudied groups. Worse performance in the understudied groups is, in part, due to being more likely to have an indeterminate drug response phenotype when compared to a European ancestry group. Having more indeterminate drug response statuses in some racial subgroups translates in to more occurrences of ""missing data"" in assessments of an individuals' drug response, thus resulting in lower racial fairness. One possible solution to this challenge of knowing if low racial fairness is a problem, is to estimate the pharmacogenomicguided drug policy performance and fairness for different racial subgroups a priori. The specific objective of this project is to use All of Us research program (All of Us research program) data to derive evidence of the potential unintended consequence of low racial fairness that can exist with a new pharmacogenomic-guided drug policy. The All of Us research program data is uniquely suited to generate such evidence given that it includes a diversity of racial subgroups and a variety of data types, including from electronic health records and clinical whole genome sequencing data. We will conduct an observational cohort study using the All of Us research program data to assess the performance of pharmacogenomicsguided drug policies to identify well-tolerated medications (Aim 1), and quantify the potential impact of differential data access among patients on performance (Aim 2). We will also study the impact of differential data access on the racial fairness of pharmacogenomics-guided drug policy (Aim 3). Outcomes of this work will demonstrate one strategy to produce evidence from real-world data that can be expanded upon and studied further in future research. Presenting this type of evidence prior to approving pharmacogenomics-guided drug policy holds promise to inform Pharmacy & Therapeutics committee decision-making.",5,5R21MD019100-02,RFA-PM-23-001,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES,14,12,7,2

Despite the recent surge in the use of immunomodulatory biologics for other inflammatory diseases, corticosteroids remain the only therapeutic for hepatic inflammation, underscoring a major unmet clinical need. While evidence indicates that a combination of ethanol-induced hepatocyte cell death and elevated circulating endotoxin drives hepatic inflammation in ALD, a major question arising is how the chronic low grade inflammation is initiated and amplified in the progression of ALD. We reported that low-dose endotoxin induces the expression of Mincle, a member of the C-type lectin receptor family that acts as a sensor for cell death, via the IRAKM-dependent TLR4 signaling in hepatic macrophages. Mincle detects components released by dead hepatocytes and activates inflammasomes and IL-1β production, serving as a critical link between cell death and inflammation in murine models of ALD. Recently, we found serum concentrations of βglucosylceramide (GluCer), a Mincle ligand released by dying hepatocytes, are increased by ethanol feeding in mice and highly elevated in sera from patients with AH. GluCer concentrations were positively correlated with disease severity in patients, suggesting that GluCer may be a major Mincle ligand driving hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in ALD. Intriguingly, Mincle activation leads to a non-lytic form of IL-1β secretion from hepatic macrophages and hepatic stellate cells (hepatic stellate cells) via a novel GSDMD-mediated biogenesis and release of small extracellular vesicles (small extracellular vesicles). The non-lytic IL-1β secretion spares hepatic macrophages from pyroptosis, allowing them to continue amplifying the inflammatory response. Importantly, our preliminary data highlight a critical pathogenic role for IL-1β containing small extracellular vesicles in potentiating ethanol-induced liver injury in mice. Mechanistically, we found that IL-1β induced the expression of SAA in hepatocytes, which in turn activated caspase3-GSDME-mediated pyroptosis. Hepatocyte pyroptosis releases the danger signal HMGB1, which can further activate caspase 1 and 11-dependent GSDMD-cleavage in neighboring hepatocytes, amplifying hepatocyte injury. This escalation of injury not only impairs liver function but likely leads to further release of GluCer, amplifying macrophage inflammatory responses. Importantly, our preliminary data reveal that GluCer also activated hepatic stellate cells, enhancing collagen deposition and aggravating liver fibrosis. By dissecting the GluCerMincle-GSDMD-IL-1β-sEV cascade, this application will evaluate strategies and identify therapeutic targets to interrupt this positive feed forward loop that amplifies the early stage hepatocyte cell death into debilitating hepatic inflammation and fibrosis.",5,5R01AA030699-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM,12,2,0,0

Characterizing the complex genetic basis of lifespan can provide insights into the mechanisms of aging, the molecular processes underlying age-related disease risk, and will inform treatments directed at maintaining health during aging. Direct genetic analysis of lifespan variation in humans is difficult due to the array of uncontrollable environmental, sociological, and economic factors at play. As a consequence, the genetic dissection of lifespan in humans has met with mixed success, and only a handful of robust lifespan-associated variants are known. Given these challenges, non-human model systems - that can be subject to exquisite environmental control, and allow great flexibility in the design of genetic experiments - remain critical tools for understanding the biology of aging, and evaluating interventions that can extend lifeand healthspan. Numerous studies have sought to employ the fruit fly model system, Drosophila melanogaster, to identify QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) contributing to lifespan and age-related phenotypes. But these studies have variously suffered from very low power to identify causative variants, poor resolution to localize QTL, are open to the confounding effects of inbreeding depression, or are experimentally inefficient. We have pioneered a novel approach that mitigates all these concerns, extending the ""extreme QTL"" or X-QTL methodology originally developed by plant breeders and yeast geneticists. We establish a highly-recombinant population from a set of sequenced strains, rear thousands of outbred diploid individuals in a ""common garden"" environment, select and sequence pools of both phenotypically-extreme and control individuals, and identify QTL via changes in allele frequency between groups. This strategy affords high power to map even very modest effect QTL, and localizes them to sufficiently small intervals that follow-up, gene-level functional testing is possible. We have successfully employed this approach to efficiently and powerfully dissect several traits. In the present proof-of-concept project we plan to extend our X-QTL method to dissect genetic variation for lifespan, as well as variation in the response to dietary restriction, a well-described life-extending treatment. Extensive simulations, along with our empirical work on other traits, suggest this is by far the highest-powered study to date aimed at identifying longevity genes in Drosophila. Results will impact the aging/lifespan field in two major ways. First, we can discover novel loci impacting lifespan traits, future characterization of which will implicate new pathways in the control of variation. Second, we can rigorously characterize differences in the genetic architecture of lifespan between sexes, and under normal and dietary restricted regimes. If successful, future elaborations of our fundamental approach could compare the genetic basis lifespan across multiple, diverse populations, and contrast genetic architecture across a range of lifespan-enhancing treatments.",1,1R21AG086734-01,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,11,8,2,0

With few notable exceptions, the functional variants in these genes and precise pathogenic mechanisms by which these variants lead to Alzheimer disease are unknown. We will continue to direct our efforts on persons of African ancestry (African ancestry), a group with a high incidence of dementia but studied much less than persons of European ancestry (European ancestry). We will leverage rich Alzheimer disease-related endophenotype and other risk factor data from the largest collection of African ancestrys assembled by us, the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (Alzheimer diseaseGC) and Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project (Alzheimer diseaseSP) for genetic studies of Alzheimer disease to promote further discovery of Alzheimer disease-related genes and variants as well as their mechanisms of action leading to Alzheimer disease. Previously, we demonstrated significant association of Alzheimer disease with SORL1, AKAP9, and other genes in African ancestrys using standard and novel analytic approaches. In the next project period, we will perform RNA sequencing on brain tissue obtained from more than 140 African ancestry Alzheimer disease cases and controls, and analyze these data using state-of-the-art bioinformatics approaches to assess the influence of Alzheimer disease risk variants on gene expression. We will construct African ancestry-specific Bayesian elastic-net models of geneticallymediated gene expression using the African ancestry brain cohort genotype and RNAseq data. These models will be applied to African ancestry cohorts from the Alzheimer diseaseGC and Alzheimer diseaseSP (total n=9,200) using PrediXcan to construct African ancestry-specific expression predictions In addition, we will identify non-genetic mediators of genetic influences on Alzheimer disease risk by  performing gene x environment GWASs of Alzheimer disease in African ancestrys using data for several established Alzheimer disease risk factors using data from the Alzheimer diseaseGC/Alzheimer diseaseSP, UK Biobank and Million Veterans Program;  applying mendelian randomization to assess the causal relationship between diabetes, cigarette smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity and Alzheimer disease in African ancestrys using existing GWAS summary statistics for these traits in African ancestrys; and  conducting a phenome-wide association study (phenome-wide association study) to identify pleiotropy by deriving a polygenic risk score for Alzheimer disease in African ancestrys and testing its association with a range of phenotypes within the UK Biobank.

The tagged proteins are then isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. Although proximity labeling"" catalysts are powerful, new proximity labeling"" catalysts are needed to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of spatially resolved proteomic mapping. Genetically encoded enzymes can be conveniently targeted to cellular locations of interest, but they are limited in their mechanisms of tagging, which hampers control over the labeling radius (limiting specificity) and restricts which amino acids can be tagged (limiting sensitivity). Synthetic proximity labeling"" catalysts have recently introduced a greater diversity of chemical labeling mechanisms, but new approaches are needed for selective activation of these catalysts in highly specific subcellular regions of interest. We propose that hybrid biological-abiotic proximity labeling"" catalysts can achieve improved sensitivity as well as specificity in spatially-resolved proteomic mapping. We are pursuing this hypotheses through the development of three classes of hybrid proximity labeling"" catalysts, which offer complementary advantages. In Aim 1, we have used directed evolution to discover heme peroxidase enzymes capable of generating highly reactive radicals, which exhibit a shorter diffusion radius and label chemically diverse amino acids, in contrast to the APEX approach that almost exclusively labels tyrosines. This ability to react with more amino acids will enhance sensitivity for detecting proximal proteins. In Aim 2, we have developed hybrid DNAsynthetic proximity labeling"" catalysts that become activated only in highly specific subcellular locations. We are applying these switchable catalysts for activation of proximity labeling"" selectively at protein-protein interactions (protein-protein interactions) on the surface of cancer cells, and we will extend this approach for activation at intercellular protein-protein interactions in neuronal synapses. In Aim 3, we have developed hybrid DNA-synthetic catalysts that tag proteins through contact-dependent mechanisms, instead of generating diffusible reactive species. We will attach these contact-dependent catalysts to DNA nanorod structures with tunable lengths and rigidities, enabling precise control over the labeling radius in the range of ~1-50 nm. We are applying all three classes of proximity labeling"" catalysts for proteomic mapping in living mammalian cells, in collaboration with Prof. Lloyd Smith, an expert in high-resolution biomolecular mass spectrometry. Additionally, we are collaborating with Prof. Edwin Chapman to employ these proximity labeling"" tools in cultured neurons to benchmark their performance against existing tools. Throughout the next five years, my laboratory will continue to develop new mechanisms for proximity labeling"" using hybrid abiotic-biological catalysts.

Cognitive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia predicts long-term disability and poor patient outcome and is not effectively treated with existing standard-of-care medications. Converging evidence indicates that a primary source of this cognitive impairment is an imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory (excitatory/inhibitory) neural responses in critical circuitry for episodic memory. In the medial temporal lobe, weakened inhibition induces an aberrant condition of increased excitation in the hippocampus of individuals with schizophrenia. The aim of this proposal is to develop novel therapeutics to remediate excitatory/inhibitory imbalances to improve cognitive function. Using a preclinical platform for drug development, the proposed research is focused on GABAA α5 receptor positive allosteric modulation (positive allosteric modulation) for the treatment of neuropsychiatric conditions characterized by heightened excitation in the hippocampus. The high expression of α5-containing GABAA receptors in the hippocampus, which mediate tonic inhibition, could be ideal for controlling excitation in this circuitry. We will use a series of small molecules with high potency and selectivity for GABAA α5 receptors and positive allosteric modulation activity at the α5 subunit that have met preclinical in vitro and in vivo drug discovery criteria with potential for translational development as therapeutic agents. The current proposed studies will advance this drug development platform to test the efficacy of two GABAA α5 receptor positive allosteric modulations to improve hippocampal-dependent cognition in a preparation of hippocampal overactivity in rodents. The studies will also assess efficacy by using fiber photometry to monitor neural hyperexcitation in the hippocampal formation during in vivo testing.

This can be accomplished through multiple mechanisms, but a frequent alteration in human cancers that protects from apoptosis is the overexpression of one or more of the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members. BCL2 itself is frequently overexpressed in multiple types of B cell lymphomas and many other lymphoid and non-lymphoid malignancies. Because of the perceived reliance of cancer cells on BCL2 for survival, a targeted specific BCL2 inhibitor was developed, ABT-199 (venetoclax). Although, venetoclax has been FDA approved for the treatment of specific leukemias, clinical trials with venetoclax have not been successful for B cell lymphomas with high levels of BCL2, such as follicular lymphomas and diffuse large B cell lymphomas (diffuse large B cell lymphomas) that have translocated or amplified BCL2. The results indicate these lymphomas do not require BCL2 for their continued survival, revealing a significant gap in knowledge of what lymphomas use to protect themselves from apoptosis. Recently, we made the unexpected discovery that BCLW, an unexplored anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member that was only thought to be important in spermatogenesis, was overexpressed in six different types of B cell lymphomas, including follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphomas. We determined patients with diffuse large B cell lymphomas containing higher levels of BCLW had reduced survival, and BCLW was more highly expressed than BCL2 in higher grade follicular lymphoma. We also showed BCLW was necessary for the survival of Burkitt lymphoma cells, and increased levels of BCLW provided resistance to Burkitt lymphoma cells to an inhibitor that targets three anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members. Therefore, we hypothesize BCLW overexpression is necessary for the survival of multiple types of B cell lymphomas and confers resistance to lymphoma cells to venetoclax and other BCL2 family inhibitors. We propose two Aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we propose to evaluate the requirements of BCLW in multiple different B cell lymphomas in relationship to other BCL2 family members and mechanisms for its overexpression. In Aim 2, we propose to determine the contribution of BCLW to resistance to inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members and ways to overcome this resistance. Completion of these Aims will significantly increase knowledge into the BCL2 family of proteins and the contribution of BCLW to B cell lymphomas and resistance to targeted inhibitors of BCL2 family members. Results are also likely to lead to improved lymphoma clinical trials, diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic interventions with knowledge based treatment combinations.",5,5R01CA236853-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,16,0,4,4

In theory, even in the absence of rods and cones, such diseased retina should still be able to sense light through intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells) using a photopigment named melanopsin. However, the kinetics of melanopsin-mediated light response is slow, thus giving only very poor temporal resolution and therefore largely limiting its ability to provide image-forming information. For the same reason, a vision restoration approach previously proposed - which made use of virally expressed melanopsin to endow light sensitivity to conventional retinal ganglion cells (retinal ganglion cells) - is also limited by the slow response kinetics of melanopsin. Our recent study has firmly established that melanopsin-mediated phototransduction is rate-limited by its downstream components and that it can be accelerated by virally expressed ion channels with faster kinetics. We propose to develop a novel vision restoration strategy by accelerating melanopsin signaling via manipulating downstream transduction components in photoreceptor degenerated mouse models. We have two major aims. In Aim 1, we shall focus on enhancing the light response of endogenous melanopsin in M4and M5-subtypes of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells because they have been shown to project to image-forming brain centers, allowing them to contribute to the image-forming vision. We have discovered that M4-cells respond to melanopsin photoactivation by elevating intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides (cNMP) and subsequent opening of cNMP-sensitive HCN channels. Our new preliminary data suggest that M5 cells also use the HCN pathway. We have further shown that the response of the HCN-dependent signaling pathway can be sped up by introducing a member of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel family, CNGA2, resulting in faster response kinetics and larger amplitudes, proving the concept of our strategy. In Aim 2, we shall restore light response in conventional retinal ganglion cells using virally expressed melanopsin together with faster signaling molecules. Our multielectrode array results show that simultaneously expressing melanopsin and CNGA2 in cretinal ganglion cells provides higher light sensitivities and faster rising phases than expressing melanopsin alone. Using water-based vision-guided maze tests, we have further found that exogenous melanopsin and CNGA2 not only restore light sensitivity but also confer pattern vision in photoreceptor-degenerated animals. Together, these exciting preliminary observations raise the prospect of using CNG channels and/or modifications to other phototransduction components of melanopsin as a therapeutic modality to restore vision following photoreceptor degeneration. Innovation. All optogenetic approaches proposed thus far focus on finding a better light-sensing protein with higher expression, better light sensitivity, and faster response kinetics. We are the first to exploit downstream components and novel signaling molecules of melanopsin for vision restoration purposes.

Eyes with advanced glaucoma are at high risk of losing the remaining vision and blindness. Retinal nerve fiber layer (Retinal nerve fiber layer) and optic nerve head measures reach their measurement floor as glaucoma progresses beyond the early stages. Hence, functional assessment of the central visual field is currently the main tool for monitoring advanced glaucoma. Our central hypothesis is that assessment of the macular retinal ganglion cell (RGC)/axonal complex can lead to improved detection or prediction of disease progression since the last RGCs to disappear in glaucoma reside in the central retina (the macula). We will test this hypothesis in a cohort of glaucoma subjects just reaching 5 years of follow-­up and validate our methods in separate cohorts of glaucoma and normal subjects. Aim 1. Are macular thickness measures able to detect change earlier and with a stronger signal compared to Retinal nerve fiber layer measures in advanced glaucoma? We will measure progression rates for global and local macular and Retinal nerve fiber layer measures within a Bayesian hierarchical framework. We will compare progression rates and the proportion of progressing eyes/regions/sectors for macular and Retinal nerve fiber layer measures to normal eyes and account for differing scales, age-­related decay, and treatment. Aim 2A. Can macular OCT thickness changes confirm and predict changes in central visual fields for advanced glaucoma? We will estimate longitudinal/temporal structure-­function relationships with Bayesian joint hierarchical longitudinal modeling of macular OCT and central 10° visual field measures. These models will determine whether there is a contemporaneous or lagged deterioration of OCT and visual field. We will assess the influence of baseline disease severity, treatment and other covariates on these joint longitudinal models. We will also compare the joint macular/central visual field models to joint models of Retinal nerve fiber layer and 24° visual fields and develop functional prediction models from 1 to 4 years ahead. Aim 2B. To validate the performance of prediction models, we will initiate a second prospectively enrolled cohort of patients meeting similar inclusion criteria and matched to the original cohort by age, gender, ethnicity and baseline glaucoma severity. We will compare visual field point predictions (e.g., one-­ or two-­visit step ahead) to the observed visual field data. Aim 3. Develop software for combining macular structural and functional data in real time as a clinical tool for detection or prediction of progression. It will provide clinicians with structural/functional rates of change and structural 'step' changes from baseline, and the probability and distribution of predicted functional changes The information provided by the application can be used during a clinical encounter to make decisions regarding ongoing management of glaucoma.

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of lung infections in the US cystic fibrosis population, with 70% of patients testing positive for S. aureus in 2018. There are two subtypes of S. aureus that are particularly worrying because they are linked to lower lung function and higher risk of death: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (or MRSA) and small colony variants (or MRSA) and small colony variants). Approximately 50% of cystic fibrosis patients test positive for MRSA and 28% test positive for MRSA) and small colony variants. Testing for S. aureus, MRSA, and SCVs heavily relies upon the collection of sputum, but as cystic fibrosis care improves and use of cystic fibrosisTR modulators increases, the production of sputum is declining, though the risk of lung infections persists. Therefore, novel methods for diagnosing lung infections without sputum are urgently needed. Our long-term goal is to develop a breath test for the detection of S. aureus MRSA and SCV in chronic cystic fibrosis lung infections. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify putative breath biomarkers of MRSA and SCVs and to determine their diagnostic accuracy. Our central hypothesis is that volatile biomarkers in breath can be used to rapidly and sensitively detect MRSA and SCVs, independent of co-infections with other species, or the presence of other S. aureus isolates.

Thus, opportunity exists to identify novel ways to better classify these low probability lesions more accurately in order to improve PPV3 and reduce biopsy of actually benign findings for hundreds of thousands of women annually. We believe that an operationally simple, cost effective, contrast enhanced mammogram (contrast enhanced mammogram), performed during the patient's diagnostic evaluation, would be the best approach to improve accuracy of radiologists' decisions for need to biopsy lesions classified with mammography, tomosynthesis (DBT) or US as 4A or 4B. contrast enhanced mammogram uses iodine contrast with dual low and high KeV mammogram images to create a contrast enhancement map of the breast that directly overlays the mammogram, thus providing anatomic and kinetic information, similar to MRI. We found in a preliminary clinical trial that radiologists had higher true-positive rates and lower false-positive rates for biopsy recommendation with contrast enhanced mammogram than when using DBT and US. To validate those initial findings, we propose to prospectively and sequentially perform contrast enhanced mammogram on 1855 consenting women with BIRADS 4A or 4B lesions detected on mammography, DBT or US. Prospectively radiologists will provide BIRADS ratings for every lesion using DBT alone, then with US and finally with contrast enhanced mammogram. With pathology known and based on the study design to minimize case by radiologist potential biases, we plan to estimate the NPV level of contrast enhanced mammogram-based recommendations (overall and within the cases with conventionally confirmed biopsy recommendation) and demonstrate that it is sufficiently high, while leading to substantial reduction in biopsy recommendations for actually benign lesions. Our primary expectation is that the number of recommendations to biopsy benign lesions will decrease significantly (~20%), while maintaining high NPV (>95%) among the initial recommendations. Using a subset of prospectively collected verified cases we will conduct a multireader (MRMC) study to assess heterogeneity of contrast enhanced mammogram effects across radiologists, obtain generalizable results, and elucidate supplemental specific contrast enhanced mammogram performance by lesion characteristics.",5,5R01CA258898-03,PAR-21-033,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,17,8,7,2

Depression of cellular immunity results in a failure to control pre-existing virus infections, such as those by the human gammaherpesviruses: the Epstein-Barr virus and the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. In some AIDS patients this results in severe disease, due to a failure to control virus-infected cells. Disease is a consequence of infection of B cells that harbor latent infection in the absence of virus replication. Previous work has shown the memory CD8 T cell response is the most important component of immune surveillance that controls latently infected cells in healthy patients. Therefore deeper understanding of CD8 T cell-mediated immune surveillance can help us understand how this response fails in AIDS patients, promoting development of strategies to restore immune surveillance to prevent gammaherpesvirus-associated diseases. This proposal will build on the novel finding that the BTB-ZF family transcription repressor Zbtb20 is essential for effective immune surveillance against murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (murine gammaherpesvirus-68). This rodent virus has proven to be an excellent model for virus-immune interactions, recapitulating many of the immune mechanisms used to control AIDS-relevant gammaherpesviruses. Preliminary data show the absence of Zbtb20 prevents the generation of cells with an effector / effector memory transcriptional signature. In addition rates of both glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism were aberrantly elevated in Zbtb20-deficient CD8 T cells, indicating an important role for Zbtb20 in regulating immunometabolic status appropriate for the differentiation state of the T cell. This is critical, as it is clear that the metabolic state of the T cell is a critical driver of differentiation to memory cells, but very little is known about the metabolic state required for long-term immune surveillance. Our transcriptomic data identify key genes in glycolytic and mitochondrial respiratory pathways that are elevated in the absence of Ztbtb20. We will test whether dysregulation of these genes leads to attrition of immune surveillance, and if gene knockdown restores appropriate T cell differentiation and immunometabolism. Further experiments test the extent to which Zbtb20 is necessary for protection from disease associated with gammaherpesvirus infection in mice lacking endogenous T cell immunity, to mimic AIDS-defining immunodeficiency. These parameters are also tested using T cells genetically modified to restore effector memory differentiation or normalize metabolic rates. In summary, the significance is a mechanistic understanding of what is required for effective immune surveillance against an important class of AIDS-associated pathogen. Armed with this knowledge, we can design improved immune-based therapies to prevent serious disease in AIDS patients.",5,5R01AI155015-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

Melanogaster Flight,"A principle aim of the NINDS is to determine how motor control is successfully implemented by the nervous system. Locomotion and balance are complex motor functions that are largely controlled by complex microcircuits that reside outside the brain. Understanding how such microcircuits function is critical to being able to treat diseases related to age, congenital disorders, and trauma in which these circuits are impaired. This proposal will leverage advantages of a highly tractable model system, the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), to elucidate the computational principles underlying the sensorimotor circuits that govern flight stabilization. Fruit flies are an excellent model system for conducting such studies for several reasons. First, through a collaborative project with the HHMI, the PI has helped develop ~220 transgenic fly lines targeting sparse populations of neurons in the fly ventral nerve cord (ventral nerve cord), which can be chronically silenced, optogenetically activated, or optogenetically suppressed. Second, in experiments pioneered by the PI, we showed that the reflexive responses of the fly to yaw, pitch, and roll perturbations are described quantitatively by a proportional-integral controller-a control strategy similar to a car's cruise control or a sophisticated thermostat. Thus, the fly's stabilization reflexes, while complex, are well characterized. Consequently, there is an opportunity to systematically interrogate neurons in the ventral nerve cord and determine their effect on a sophisticated motor behavior. Towards this end, in Aim 1 we will map the function of the motor system that actuates rapid flight stabilization in flies. Specifically, we will chronically silence or transiently manipulate individual motor neurons that innervate wing steering muscles and test control performance in free flight and under rapid mechanical perturbations. In Aim 2 we will elucidate the functional role specific mechanosensory neurons in the control reflex. Once again we will use chronic silencing or transient manipulation of individual mechanosensory neurons and test control performance in free flight and under rapid mechanical perturbations. Finally, in Aim 3 we will identify the neural architecture connecting the mechanosensory inputs to the wing muscle outputs. Specifically, we will use anterograde transsynaptic circuit tracing (trans-Tango) and ex-vivo functional imaging to identify motor and interneurons that receive direct input from the genetically-identified mechanosensory afferents. Together, these studies will enable us to determine with unprecedented detail the organization and function of these microcircuits. In turn, this knowledge will inform our understanding of design principles for sensorimotor circuits across animals.",5,5R01NS116595-03,RFA-NS-18-030,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

Over 70% of patients with cancer involve family in health decisions, including choices about treatments, surgery, location of care, accessing palliative care, and many others. Patients making these decisions with unprepared family caregivers may experience inadequate family decision support leading to heightened distress and receipt of care/treatments inconsistent with their values and preferences. This in turn may increase distress for family caregivers. There is a critical need to train cancer family caregivers to effectively support patient decision-making; however, few palliative care interventions have been tested to enhance caregiver skills in providing decision support. We have developed CAre Supporters Coached to be Adept DEcision partners (CAre Supporters Coached to be Adept DEcision partners), a lay navigator-led, telehealth early palliative care intervention to train advanced cancer caregivers how to effectively partner with patients in health decisionmaking. Evolving out of our prior early palliative care caregiving interventions, decision support relevant content for family caregivers includes principles of effective social support, communication, and Ottawa Decision Guide training; however we do not know which of these components and component interactions influences patient and caregiver decision-making outcomes. Traditional research approaches treat interventions as ""bundled"" treatment packages, making it difficult to assess definitively which intervention components can be reduced, eliminated, or replaced to improve efficiency. Hence, we propose a randomized 23 (2x2x2) factorial trial, the first such trial in oncology palliative care, using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (Multiphase Optimization Strategy) to test components of CAre Supporters Coached to be Adept DEcision partners in order to assemble an optimized, scalable version of the intervention. 352 family caregivers of persons with newly-diagnosed advanced cancer will be randomized to receive one or more palliative care lay navigator-delivered decision partnering training components, based on the Ottawa Decision Support Framework and Social Support Effectiveness Theory: 1) psychoeducation on social support effectiveness in decision support (1 vs. 3 sessions); 2) decision support communication training (yes vs. no); and 3) Ottawa Decision Guide training); and 3) Ottawa Decision Guide training (yes vs. no); and 3) Ottawa Decision Guide training). We will determine CAre Supporters Coached to be Adept DEcision partners components (main effects/interactions) that contribute meaningfully to patient and caregiver outcomes, including patient healthcare utilization (Aim 1) and use those results to build a version of the CAre Supporters Coached to be Adept DEcision partners intervention that is maximally effective and scalable (Aim 2). To maximize recruitment, we will recruit from two NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers in Birmingham, AL and Atlanta, GA. Using the innovative Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework will yield a highly novel and cost effective version of CAre Supporters Coached to be Adept DEcision partners primed for confirmatory RCT testing, scalability, and reproducibility.",5,5R01CA262039-04,PAR-19-352,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,1,3,3,2

However, despite the great advancement towards the understanding of the connection between inflammation, AD development and aging-related pathologies, there are several important aspects, which are still very much under investigated. For example albeit it is appreciate the existence of the lymphatic system, as a brain-to-periphery communication conduit, it is still unknown the role played by the lymph in the inflammatory/degenerative process occurring in the brain parenchyma and in transporting the brain molecular signature to the cervical nodes for immune-surveillance. Another important aspect, yet to be investigated, are the very early changes in endosomal proteostasis and the proteome post-translational modifications, occurring before bona fide AD and aging degenerative changes are observed. Finally, despite the fact that active and passive immunotherapy has been proposed for AD the role of MHCII-restricted immune response to naturally processed TAU, Aβ and other brain self-antigens is still unknown. As such the trust of this application is to: (i) explore the role played by the lymphatic circulation in transporting the inflammatory/degenerative molecular signature of the brain parenchyma to the draining cervical node (with P1 and Core B) (ii) map the very early changes in the brain proteome, PTMmodifications, endo-lysosomal proteostasis and autophagic machinery (with P1 and Core C) (iii) analyze changes in the MHC II-restricted immune-peptidome, and related T cell responses, during aging and the different phases of AD progression (with P3 and Core B). By using state-of the art quantitative proteomic, associated with a cell biology approach, we will map proteins PTMs at different stages of the aging process and AD development as well as their effect on endo-lysosomal proteostasis and the autophagic machinery. Additionally we will investigate the lymph inflammatory/degenerative signature in young and old mice, as well as, AD mice at different stage of disease. Finally, the MHC II-immunopeptidome, eluted from dendritic cells in the cervical node, will be analyzed by MS/MS to map peptides derived from brain-relevant proteins in aging and at different stages of AD. Tetramer staining, using relevant MHC-II-peptides, will be employed to analyze T cell recognition and address the overall immune responses to brain antigens. Altogether results from this project will provide a progressive snap shot of how the cellular proteome is modified during the early-to-late stages of AD or aging development, how the autophagic machinery is involved in disposing the modified proteome, how these early changes progressively develop into complex aggregates and how the endo-lysosomal system is involved in restoring proteostasis. Additionally, how the lymphatic system function as a conduit to transport the inflammatory/degenerative phenotype associated with AD development to the immune system and conversely how immune cells respond to proteomic changes in aging and during AD progression.",5,5P01AG031782-17,PAR-18-297,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,2,6,6,1

Cell competition helps to eliminate sporadic aneuploid cells that have abnormal chromosome numbers. Aneuploidy contributes to almost all carcinogenesis and is a hallmark of aging, contributing to cellular senescence. The current project investigates the mechanisms by which genes that encode ribosomal proteins, by virtue of their wide distribution in the genome and stoichiometric requirement for ribosome biogenesis, are used as sensors for altered cellular chromosome content, using fruitflies as a genetic model system. Importantly, cells with single mutations in ribosomal protein genes can also be recognized and removed from developing tissues by the process of cell competition with nearby normal cells, related to the elimination of aneuploid cells. This project will further define the molecular mechanisms of cell competition pathways by gain and loss of function genetics targeted specifically to aneuploid cells within otherwise normal tissues, and characterize the alterations in gene expression that result from cell competition on a single cell level. The relationship of specific chromosome gains and losses to tumor formation will be defined. The mechanisms whereby the p53 protein protects the genome from progressive genome damage, and the route by which genomic changes accumulate in the progression towards cancer, will be elucidated.

Breast cancers originate in the inner luminal layer of the mammary epithelium, where transformed luminal epithelial cells (luminal epithelial cells) proliferate to fill the ducts and lobules in ductal carcinoma in situ. Surprisingly, luminal epithelial cells in ductal carcinoma in situ have acquired all the necessary genetic aberrations to invade, but remain constrained within the tissue by an intact outer myoepithelial (myoepithelial) layer-a group of cells that forms a dynamic barrier blocking access of the in situ tumor to the basement membrane (BM, the specialized extracellular matrix (extracellular matrix) that surrounds the mammary epithelium). Thus, we propose that translocation of transformed luminal epithelial cells past the myoepithelial layer, and not genetic mutations, is a key ratelimiting step in progression to invasive ductal carcinoma. Here, we aim to identify the physical and molecular changes that must occur in luminal epithelial cells to facilitate this structural transition. We approach this challenge through the lens of mammary epithelial self-organization. We previously demonstrated that normal human luminal epithelial cells and myoepithelial can self-organize in vitro, and that the capacity of myoepithelial to exclude luminal epithelial cells from the BM is determined by hard-wired and lineage-specific interfacial tensions at each cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interface. We showed using experiments and mathematical modeling that the luminal epithelial cells-extracellular matrix interface is highly unfavorable energetically compared to the myoepithelial-extracellular matrix interface, which prevents luminal epithelial cells from positioning themselves next to the BM. We hypothesize the existence of a rate-limiting and high-energy structural intermediate during the progression of ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive ductal carcinoma, where luminal epithelial cells translocate into the myoepithelial layer, next to the BM. We propose a statistical mechanical framework for understanding how perturbations to the interfacial properties and dynamics of tumor cells facilitate the formation of this intermediate. Specifically, we predict that changes to the luminal epithelial cells-extracellular matrix interfacial energy are a critical physical change necessary to promote basal translocation of transformed luminal epithelial cells. Preliminary studies support this hypothesis: we found that a frequently dysregulated gene-PIK3CA-disrupts self-organization when activated in luminal epithelial cells by rendering the luminal epithelial cells-extracellular matrix interface more energetically favorable. In this proposal, we will determine whether this and other physical changes to luminal epithelial cells are necessary for their basal translocation, and identify the molecular changes downstream of PIK3CA that give rise to these physical changes. We will test our hypothesis using complementary in vitro and in vivo experimental systems: using organoids reconstituted from human reduction mammoplasty tissues and genetically engineered mouse models. Our long-term goal is to reveal the changes that promote and inhibit progression from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive ductal carcinoma. Better physical and molecular predictors of progression would benefit ductal carcinoma in situ patients who would otherwise be over-treated, as only a third of ductal carcinoma in situ cases progress to invasive ductal carcinoma. Further, blocking luminal epithelial cells translocation would represent a therapeutic strategy to prevent breast cancer progression.",5,5U01CA244109-05,PAR-19-101,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Team-based ""coordinated specialty care"" (CSC)4 for early psychosis (early psychosis) has established effectiveness in promoting clinical and functional recovery 5 . early psychosis treatment programs have expanded rapidly with increased funding across the US without formal coordination of training or implementation. While early psychosis programs share many features, the lack of state and national coordination and data infrastructure limits the capacity for large-scale evaluation or accelerated dissemination of best practices 6. Based on prior collaborations with 30 California (California) early psychosis programs and experiences using mobile health (MOBI mHealth) technology to measure individual outcomes in early psychosis care, the UC Davis (UC Davis) team is uniquely poised to create early psychosisI-CaliforniaL, a California network that will contribute systematically collected outcomes data on over 1000 first episode of psychosis clients per year, from 6 community and 6 university early psychosis clinics, to a national early psychosis network supported by the NIMH early psychosisINET program. Building on our prior work evaluating California early psychosis programs, early psychosisI-CaliforniaL programs will participate in a formative evaluation in Year 1 to define core early psychosis clinical features, intervention targets, and outcomes needed to harmonize network input. A ""core battery"" based on current measures collected at the sites, the PhenX toolkit 7 and expanded to cover all critical domains, will be installed across the network in Year 2.

For example, local anesthetics are extremely efficacious at blocking pain elicited by a variety of pain conditions that arise in the periphery. Unfortunately, local anesthetics inhibit all sensory, as well as motor, neurons. Our long-term goal is to identify new compounds that specifically inhibit nociceptors but spare other sensory and motor neurons. Such compounds, especially those that are peripherally restricted (do not enter the CNS), would be effective and safer analgesics. The immediate goal of this project, in response to the ""Assay Development and Neurotherapeutic Agent Identification"" R61/R33 FOA, is to develop an in vitro assay to screen natural product libraries for novel and selective nociceptor inhibitory compounds with much higher throughput than is currently available. We will engineer calcitonin gene-related peptide (calcitonin gene-related peptide) receptor expressing ""sniffer cells"" able to detect nociceptor activity. Using cocultures of nociceptors (derived from adult rat sensory ganglia from an inflammatory pain model) and calcitonin gene-related peptide sniffer cells, we will screen natural product libraries for compounds that inhibit stimulated nociceptor activity. The use of nociceptors themselves, that are the direct target for newly identified compounds, provides a strong biological rationale with high likelihood that compounds identified will be efficacious analgesic agents in vivo. Further, due to high congruence between mammalian nociceptors, the assay will have high translational validity for efficacy at human nociceptors. The Aims for this application are: Aim 1(R61), engineer sniffer cells that are highly sensitive to the neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide; Aim 2 (R61), develop, validate and optimize a co-culture assay (calcitonin gene-related peptide sniffer cells with sensory neurons derived from rats treated with CFA) to assess known compounds that inhibit nociceptor activity stimulated by a physiological inflammatory soup; and Aim 3 (R33), screen a prefractionated natural product library from the Developmental Therapeutics Program (Developmental Therapeutics Program) of the NCI to identify novel compounds that inhibit nociceptor activity. Pre-fractions from the Developmental Therapeutics Program natural products extract library, which currently consists of over 326,000 fractions, will be tested for selective inhibition of activated nociceptors using the assay developed in the R61 phase. Positive hits will be those that reduce nociceptor activity by ≥ 25% without altering fluorescence in sniffer cells (±calcitonin gene-related peptide) alone.

These capsules, when reached by the crack, are broken and release the healing agent, inhibiting its propagation. However, there are several critical gaps and crucial improvements to make this approach suitable and commercially viable. Our long-term goals are to introduce optimized healing agents, minimize the side effects of addition of the capsules, via shell wall functionalization, and validate advanced method for encapsulation. Previous studies revealed that low viscosity amides are capable of modulating the polymerization reaction, and more tough and degradationresistant than methacrylates, so these compounds are going to be used as alternative healing agents. In addition, thiourethane surface functionalization has been shown to be an efficient method to increase fracture toughness and reduce polymerization stress, so we propose to functionalize the capsule surface with this compound -the methods for functionalization were developed in my post-doctoral mentor's laboratory, which increases the chance of success. Finally, we aim at overcoming the main issues involved in the doubleemulsion method, such as poor size control of the capsules and high sensitivity of the method, by utilizing the green chemistry coaxial electrohydrodynamic atomization (coaxial electrohydrodynamic atomization) technique for the encapsulation process. In summary, the following Specific Aims are proposed to:  Introduce amides as healing agents,  Functionalize the microcapsule's surface with thiourethane oligomers, and  Improve encapsulation process with advanced technology. The K99 mentored phase has been focused on tailoring and optimizing the microcapsules synthesis in order to encapsulate properly compounds with different hydrophilicities and minimize the healing agent leakage. The second main goal of this phase was to enhance the double torsion fracture toughness technique to assess the healing efficiency and the kinetics of the crack propagation under a more clinically relevant scenario. Collected data has highlighted that the incorporation of the microcapsules into the thermosetting polymeric networks changes dramatically the kinetics of the crack formation and propagation. Therefore, in the independent phase of this proposal, the crack growth kinetics and the polymer healing will be closely monitored by the incorporation of fluorescent dyes into the encapsulated healing agents, the investigation of the magnitude of the effects promoted by the addition of the microcapsules in systems containing the unreacted compound triethylene glycol dibutanoate, and the use of digital image correlation (digital image correlation) technology. The central hypothesis is that the tough healing agent, shell wall functionalization, and introduction of coaxial electrohydrodynamic atomization method to produce capsules will significantly increase the potential and viability of self-healing dental materials. This proposal will broadly impact the field by modifying and improving essential self-healing components and developing an alternative method for encapsulation process, making this approach a tangible resource for resin composites survival.",5,5R00DE028876-05,PAR-16-156,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH,15,2,0,0

They allow patients to receive necessary medication infusions, but are often bulky, tethered to the user with tubing, and associated with pain at the insertion site. These shortcomings make drug regimen adherence harder for infusion pump users, particularly those with chronic conditions. To eliminate barriers to infusion therapy adherence, there is a critical need for compact, lightweight infusion devices that don't impede physical activity. Our long-term goal is to improve infusion therapy adherence by developing featherweight arterial pulse-driven infusion pump technology that eliminates the need for painful cannula insertions and motors and batteries to facilitate pumping. Our overall objectives in this project, the next steps toward our long-term goal, are to (i) characterize the infusion rate capabilities of a prototype pulse-driven micropump based on our recent advances in bio-inspired microfluidic pump technology, and (ii) tune the micropump design to deliver a set of target infusion rates within its range by way of physical experiments, computational modeling, and AI-guided optimization. Our central hypothesis is that our pulsedriven microfluidic pump technology, which mimics natural biological function, can provide drug delivery rates appropriate for clinical applications like ambulatory chemotherapy for a wide range of users with varying arterial pulse profiles. Our hypothesis is based on preliminary data demonstrating the proof-of-concept that our prototype micropump can be powered by the human radial artery pulse and produce flow rates appropriate for chemotherapy and insulin delivery. The project's rationale is that, before the proposed pulse-driven micropump can be developed for clinical use, its capabilities must be characterized, allowing its design to be optimized for specific applications. To attain these objectives, the following specific aims will be pursued. First, we will determine the dependence of the micropump flow rate on device design parameters and arterial pulse characteristics using in vitro and in vivo tests with rapid prototype micropumps produced using microfluidic fabrication techniques and 3D printing; next, we will develop a 3D finite element model (finite element model) of the prototype micropump; finally, we will use an evolutionary algorithm along with human subject and porcine skin transdermal flow rate testing to develop an initial set of 6 wearable infusion patch pump designs integrated with microneedle arrays. Upon project completion, we expect our contribution to be a featherweight pulse-driven infusion pump capable of producing a wide range of infusion rates that can be integrated into low-cost, disposable infusion devices the size of a nicotine patch, or in state-of-the-art closed-loop and implantable infusions systems, greatly reducing the footprint of both types of devices. This advance in infusion technology is expected to increase users' adherence to their drug regimens, reduce risk of diabetic hyperglycemic crises, and improve quality of life for many patients.

The available treatment tools include immunosuppressive drugs and the recently added Benlysta and the calcineurin inhibitor, voclosporin. They are not specific drugs with the first three causing major side effects, whereas, the last two have a small, albeit desirable, clinical benefit. Better understanding of the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis will advance our progress towards the development of reliable biomarkers and approaches to treat patients in a precise manner. Early studies have indicated that kidney resident cells (podocytes, mesangial and tubular epithelial cells) when exposed to the autoinflammatory environment that is prevalent in patients with lupus nephritis, they upregulate immunomodulatory molecules including a serine/threonine kinase IV (CaMK4) and interleukin 23 receptor (interleukin 23 receptor) which enable kidney inflammation and damage. When kidney resident cells lack any of these molecules, inflammation is averted. Importantly, urine podocytes and tubular epithelial cells present molecular abnormalities which reflect those in the kidney tissue. In this project, the hypothesis will be tested that in response to peripheral autoimmune elements, kidney resident cells undergo molecular changes which are requisite for the development of kidney inflammation and injury. The hypothesis will be tested in three sets of experiments. In the first it will be demonstrated that CaMK4 and interleukin 23 receptor in podocytes are requisite for the development off lupus nephritis; in the second it will be demonstrated that upregulation of CaMK4 and IL23R in tumular epithelial cells alters their metabolic profile and enables them to produce chemokines that attract inflammatory cells leading to lupus nephritis; in the third a pilot clinical study will be performed to first demonstrate that upregulation of CaMK4 and interleukin 23 receptor in urine cells reflects kidney tissue pathology, and second, that the recording of these molecules in the urine can predict the development of lupus nephritis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The project will use a number of novel tools availed in the laboratory and by the cores (single cell and spatial transcriptomics and nanoparticle delivery of medicine to kidney resident cells) of this project program grant along with conditionally knock out mice and a well-established lupus cohort.

However, we still do not have a comprehensive picture of the dynamic connections and activities of neuronal networks in the brain that express the opioid receptors and peptides. Therefore, a critical need exists to map the global cell-type identity, transcriptomic trajectory, shifting connectivity, and ensemble activity of the key opioidergic networks underlying the onset and maintenance of cellular dependence, and withdrawal. This proposal aims to investigate the architecture and function of endogenous MOR-expressing neural circuits in key cortical and subcortical brain regions, in order to determine how these circuits maintain cellular dependence and drive brain-wide maladaptive plasticity across different stages of the OUD cycle. In four complementary aims, we will first map the shifting structural and functional connectivity of opioidergic networks using viral-genetic and tissue clearing methods to identify monosynaptic inputs to all MOR-expressing, as well as withdrawal-active MOR-expressing neurons, as a function of opioid exposure and abstinence. We will then integrate these dynamic neuroanatomical maps with cell-type information and gene expression changes by combing single-nuclei sequencing and spatial cellular-resolution transcriptomics via hyper-multiplexed in situ hybridizations to generate the anatomic localization of hundreds of dependence-related genes, targeted to cell types and retro-labeled connections. Lastly, to reveal how MOR-expressing cells within the cortical and subcortical target regions are modulated during opioid exposure in real-time, we will use miniature head-mounted microscopes to image the neural ensemble activities across weeks of opioid exposure and withdrawal. To bridge these experimental measurements and provide a common framework for our analyses, we will adopt Network Control Theory to identify brain nodes that drive the transition between opioid dependence states to identify potential candidates that disproportionately drive each state. Our datasets will provide formal summaries and a publicly available, searchable database logging the activity, connectivity, and gene expression as they evolve with repetitive opioid exposure, withdrawal, and abstinence.",5,5R01DA056599-03,RFA-DA-22-011,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,0,1,8,1

These leaks often require immediate life-saving measures to stabilize for subsequent reparative interventions. Continued care can further be complicated by chronic air leaks (bronchopleural fistula, BPF) requiring need for prolonged chest tube drainage and/or invasive surgery and can be difficult to manage. These all result in significantly increased morbidity, mortality, hospital stays, health care costs, and other complications. However, at present there are only limited options for directly repairing pleural leaks, particularly chronic leaks, and new therapeutic interventions are critically needed. We have developed a novel sealant patch consisting of dopamine-conjugated methacrylated seaweed-derived alginate (a novel sealant patch consisting of dopamine-conjugated methacrylated seaweed-derived alginate). The patch has desired materials properties, including tailorable stiffness, elasticity, and adhesive strength, and is easily transported and applied to the lung surface. We have further designed, tested, and documented safety and efficacy in initial pre-clinical studies utilizing ex vivo and in vivo small and large (rat/pig) models of lung injuries. We now propose to further define optimal GMP-grade manufacturing, sterilization, and storage conditions, and to further define longitudinal safety and efficacy in the small (rat) and large (pig) animal models of pleural injuries. This will include assessing sealant patch efficacy with larger wounds and also assess efficacy of shelf-stored patches. We will also engage with the FDA for development of initial clinical investigations and a Pre-Sub (Q) meeting is scheduled for April 10, 2023.

However, these strategies often involve the administration of supraphysiological doses of growth factors, which have been reported to lead to serious off-target tissue responses, including heterotopic ossification (bone formation at undesirable places), osteolysis, and swelling. The objective of this proposal is to design osteoinductive biomaterials to induce in situ bone regeneration in the absence of exogenous growth factors. This project builds upon the PI's extensive published and preliminary data on a new class of two-dimensional (2D) mineral-based nanoparticles, known as nanosilicates, to induce osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in the absence of growth factors. Also, nanosilicate-based shear-thinning biomaterials can be used for minimally invasive cell therapy. The central hypothesis is that nanosilicate-based biomaterials will activate endogenous cells to promote bone formation in the absence of exogenous growth factors. To test this hypothesis three independent specific aims are proposed:  Elucidate the molecular mechanism of nanosilicate-induced osteoinductivity;  Design 3D printed nanosilicates-loaded microporous scaffolds for rapid cellular invasion and angiogenesis; and  Demonstrate in situ bone regeneration using 3D printed nanosilicates-loaded microporous scaffolds. It is expected that the ability of nanosilicate-based biomaterials to induce in situ bone regeneration by stimulating endogenous cells will circumvent the current clinical limitations associated with the use of supraphysiological doses of growth factors. The proposed research is significant because it will advance and expand the understanding of how this new class of 2D nanomaterials can be used in bone tissue engineering. The completion of the proposed work will provide a new class of osteoinductive biomaterials for future studies in larger animal models and eventually advance bone regeneration approaches for humans.",1,1R01DE032031-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH,15,2,0,0

Studies also demonstrate that certain pregnancy conditions (e.g., preeclampsia) and outcomes (e.g., preterm birth) are associated with adverse health later in the life of the mother. However, research is lacking on the relationships between exposures in pregnancy and later health of the mother, and how pregnancy outcomes impact those associations. Puerto Rico suffers from elevated rates of numerous morbidities compared to the mainland U.S., including preterm birth and Type II diabetes. Puerto Rico also has a history of extensive contamination with increased human exposure to a range of pollutants. We established the PROTECT cohort in the northern coast of Puerto Rico to study the impacts of exposure to an array of environmental chemicals during gestation and adverse pregnancy outcomes. We have developed an incredibly rich dataset on exposures, biomarkers of intermediate effects, questionnaires, and health record information. PROTECT is also a participating cohort within the newly established US-wide ECHO study, following the development of children born into PROTECT. We propose building upon this vast dataset and continued recruitment in PROTECT, along with the repeated participant contact during the ECHO follow-up visits, to investigate status and longitudinal trajectories of maternal metabolic health and endocrine function for up to five years following pregnancy among 1000 women in Puerto Rico. We have exposure biomarker data from repeated samples collected in pregnancy on urinary phthalate metabolites, phenols/parabens, and PAH metabolites, as well as 17 metals measured in both urine and blood. In this study, with new data and sample collection on PROTECT mothers at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years following delivery, we aim to: 1) Determine whether maternal exposures during pregnancy are associated with measures and trajectories of metabolic health (i.e., body size, body composition, physical strength, clinical diagnoses, blood pressure, and blood glucose, insulin, lipids, HbA1c) in shortand long-term follow-up assessments after delivery; 2) Investigate the relationships between maternal exposures during pregnancy and longitudinal measures of endocrine function (e.g., estradiol, testosterone, SHBG, FSH and AMH) in the follow-up assessments after delivery; and 3) Explore effect modification of the associations between pregnancy exposures and later women's health from the first two aims by pregnancy complications (gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm birth), and/or by social determinants (socioeconomic status, social support, depression, stress, life experiences, and others) and other physical determinants of health (body size, physical activity, breast feeding, polycystic ovarian syndrome, menstrual patterns, and others).

There are approximately 7000 distinct rare diseases, creating a substantial collective public health burden. Approximately 80% of rare diseases are genetic, and molecular diagnosis is essential for the management, treatment, and development of therapy. In Indiana there are several barriers to identification of rare disease and access to care: Indiana is a state that has a longstanding history of being underserved for genetics services; there is a large rural population; the education level is in the bottom quartile among states and the median income level is also in the bottom echelon. We have outstanding expertise in rare disease within the state, but it is geographically concentrated. For all these reasons, we recognize that while genetics holds the promise of improving health outcomes, it also may serve to widen health inequity. Our development of the Indiana Collaborative for Undiagnosed Rare Disease is based on the concept that we must be inclusive in our approach to rare disease to implement access to care and diagnostics that will significantly impact statewide health. Our collaborative team also includes experts in urban medicine, community-based participation in research, and health inequity. Our central goal is to improve the health of Indiana by improving recognition, access, and diagnostic evaluation for patients at risk for rare diseases. Using a multi-omics approach that combines genome sequencing (genome sequencing), transcriptomics, metabolic testing, and proteomics with deep phenotyping, we will leverage the resources and expertise of our collaborative network. We propose to overcome the barriers/challenges to improving undiagnosed rare disease by 1) consolidating statewide rare disease expertise, leveraging our UDN Diagnostic center of excellence; 2) partnering with communities and experts in health care disparity to develop a novel toolkit to screen patients at risk for rare disease and to implement telehealth NICU genomics screening using a toolkit already piloted at IU and found to have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of genetic disease; and 3) developing innovative approaches to rare disease discovery and training including technologies aimed at improving the post-exome/genome diagnosis rate.

About a third of the compounds had at least one chiral center. In addition, practical aspects of manufacturing still need to be addressed to market a cost effective drug. Thus discovery of fundamentally new catalytic reactions, especially enantioselective ones, showing high turnover frequencies (i.e., substrate/ catalyst/unit time), that use readily available precursors, will have a significant impact on medicinal and process chemistry. Through an approach that relies heavily on mechanistic insights we strive to discover new enantioselective reactions of alkenes and alkynes. For example, use of low-valent chiral (L*)cobalt complexes has enabled heterodimerization between a broad range of 1,3-dienes, and, ethylene and alkyl acrylates, which are feedstock materials. The products of these reactions are synthetically valuable chiral 1,4-skipped dienes (produced in >90% yield and ee) which can be turned into pharmaceutically relevant classes of compounds. Examples cited include anti-microbial and anti-tumor and antifungal agents, GABA analogs, and metalloproteinase inhibitors. On-going mechanistic studies strongly suggest the intermediacy of a cationic {[P~P)Co(L)]+}Xspecies in these exceptionally selective C-C bond-forming reactions that proceed under ambient conditions. Most remarkably, we recently (2018/2019) found that the chiral cationic Co(I) complexes with custom-designed ligands catalyze enantioselective [2+2]-additions of alkynes and vinyl-X derivatives, opening, arguably, the best route to enantiopure 3-substituted cyclobutenes, potential precursors other valuable compounds. In sharp contrast to 1,3-dienes, 1,3-enynes form, initially, vinylcyclobutenes and then, in a tandem fashion, highly functionalized cyclobutanes with an all-carbon quaternary centers. Such reactions are highly efficient and uncommon. Preliminary results also indicate that chiral cationic Co(I)-complexes catalyze at least 4 other types of reactions (hydroboration, hydroacylation and hydrosilylation of prochiral 1,3-dienes, and, cyclizaion/HV of 1,6enynes). We plan to explore how many of the combinations of reactions can be run in tandem, in attempts to exploit the full potential of the new cobalt chemistry in organic syntheis. Historically some of the reactions we work on had been carried out using precious metals. We expect, when fully devloped, cobalt (which is 100 to 200 time cheaper than Rh for example), will be able to catalyze some of these basic reactions.

Many children who fail to meet their potential have suffered from major life events that lead to downward spirals in health, cognitive development, and ultimately lower human capital accumulation. China's major social, economic, and demographic transitions have led to more than a third of all children and adolescents in rural China who are left behind by one or both parents who migrate for job opportunities. Yet, there are fundamental gaps in understanding:  the mechanisms through which such major life events affect health and development; and  the moderating and mediating factors that may buffer these impacts on human capital. The China Health and Nutrition Survey (China Health and Nutrition Survey) is an NIH-funded study of more than 41,000 individuals followed over 35 years, capturing dramatic and rapid modernizationand environment-related changes in individual, household and community environments. The China Health and Nutrition Survey offers high quality, unique and extraordinary, intergenerational data that capture the interdependent biological, health, social, and environmental factors that affect child development over time and under conditions of enormous environmental change (e.g., the end of the one-child policy, migration of adults to seek work, leaving their children behind with grandparents, and closures of village schools sending children away from their families to attend boarding schools). We propose data collection from individuals aged 0-45 years in an additional round in 2021, preserving the continuity of China Health and Nutrition Survey, while adding new measures of age-specific cognitive and non-cognitive skills, parental, school and community investments. We propose data collection and dissemination of this ongoing and valuable public resource. These data will provide the unique opportunity to understand complex biological, social, and environmental dynamics of multiple dimensions of human capital in context of new social, economic and demographic shifts. We propose to identify life-stage-specific exposures that predict cognitive function, school attainment, and height and test hypotheses about how investments in health, nutrition, and education shape human capital and foster resilience in the face of rapid changes. In addition, we propose to identify how changing dietary patterns, including intakes of sodium, potassium, and ""modern diets"" relate to body mass, waist circumference, and blood pressure from youth into adulthood (ages 0-45 years). Adding an 11th wave of multipurpose data will augment the already high value and utility of the China Health and Nutrition Survey, by including an expanded focus on cognitive and noncognitive skills, parental, school and community investments, allowing for the study of the dynamics and early life antecedents of human capital accumulation, with a focus on modifiable factors with potential to buffer adverse life events and augment health and human capital.

Importantly, the reported annual incidence captures only a small fraction of the real number of individuals infected with tick-borne pathogens. The broad spectrum of clinically important tick-borne diseases includes Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, babesiosis, and Spotted Fever rickettsiosis. Spotted Fever group rickettsiae include R. rickettsii (Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, RMSF), R. conorii (Mediterranean Spotted Fever), and R. parkeri (Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis) as well as many newly discovered Rickettsia species with unknown pathogenicity. Doxycycline is considered as the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of tick-borne rickettsiosis; however, delay in diagnosis and antibiotic treatment can lead to severe disease and death. The search for long-term immune protection against invasive rickettsial diseases (RMSF and epidemic typhus caused by R. prowazekii) has been a goal since the discovery of the causative microorganisms by Dr. Howard T.

However, whole cell live-attenuated or formalin/phenolinactivated vaccines generate limited protective immune responses in humans and, because of safety concerns, are no longer considered for rickettsial vaccine development. We have developed kkaebi transposon mutagenesis technology and studied the genetic requirements of the rickettsial intracellular life-cycle (bacterial attachment to and invasion into host cells, escape from endo-lysosome, intracellular replication, and release from host cells). This work determined that the polysaccharide synthesis operon (polysaccharide synthesis operon) is responsible for Oantigen biosynthesis, contributes to pathogenesis, and is essential for the development of bactericidal WeilFelix antibodies. Immunization with carbohydrate conjugate vaccines, including the capsular polysaccharide or the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide, generated serotype-specific protective immunity that correlated with the induction of bactericidal antibodies.

Klebsiella pneumoniae, which commonly causes pneumonia and sepsis in hospitalized, immunosuppressed, and chronically ill patients, was responsible for 17.5% of the deaths associated with antimicrobial resistance and 19.9% of the deaths attributable to antimicrobial resistance. Due to the dwindling antibiotic pipeline, other approaches to target these infections are needed. We propose to develop K. pneumoniae vaccines to prevent these infections from occurring, thereby reducing the need for antimicrobial therapy and interrupting pathogen transmission. Here, we describe development of a live attenuated K. pneumoniae vaccine with excellent safety and tolerability while maintaining immunogenicity. The main goal of the current application is to show that we can develop live oral K. pneumoniae vaccines with excellent safety due to reduced potential for transmission, designated here as Live Attenuated Non-Transmissible (Live Attenuated Non-Transmissible) vaccines. To achieve this goal, we will genetically engineer a live attenuated K. pneumoniae candidate vaccine in which arabinose-controlled synthesis of the essential single stranded DNA-binding protein (single stranded DNA-binding protein) strictly limits post-vaccination replication.

These adjustments, which include increases in peripheral vascular resistance, cardiac contractility and rate, function to increase arterial blood flow and oxygen to the exercising muscles, and in turn support their ability to contract. This neural mechanism has been named the exercise pressor reflex and its afferent arm is comprised of group III and IV fibers whose endings are located in and near the muscle interstitium. In patients with peripheral artery disease (peripheral artery disease) the exercise pressor reflex is exaggerated. The overall goal of the experiments proposed in this application is to shed light on the role played by lactic acid in evoking the exercise pressor reflex in both health and simulated peripheral artery disease. The proposed experiments will pay particular attention to Acid Sensing Ion Channels (Acid Sensing Ion Channels) and will focus on the role that they play in evoking the exaggerated exercise pressor reflex in peripheral artery disease. Lactic acid, produced by contracting skeletal muscles is believed to stimulate group III and IV afferents, signaling the spinal cord and brainstem that the arterial blood supply to working muscle is not meeting its metabolic demand. In the proposed experiments, we will pay particular attention to two important Acid Sensing Ion Channels isoforms, namely Acid Sensing Ion Channels1a and Acid Sensing Ion Channels3. We will examine in decerebrated unanesthetized rats the responses to contraction of group III and IV muscle afferents both before and after either pharmacological blockade of the above receptors or after they have been ""knocked down"" with siRNA. The proposed experiments will also examine the responses to contraction of these afferents before and after knockdown of myophosphorylase in the triceps surae muscles. In addition the responses of group III and IV afferents to contraction in mutant rats whose Acid Sensing Ion Channels3 has been functionally inactivated by CRISPR Cas 9 technology will be determined. The proposed experiments will be performed both in rats with freely perfused femoral arteries and in rats with femoral arteries that have been ligated for 72 hours before the start of the experiment. The latter preparation simulates the arterial blood flow patterns seen in patients with peripheral artery disease and therefore serves as a useful animal model of this disease.

Synapse loss has been a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and shows the most robust correlation with the disease symptoms. This process occurs long before massive neuron death and Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, indicating its central role in disease pathogenesis. However, molecular mechanisms underlying synapse degeneration remain incompletely understood. Our proposal aims to study this process by investigating a novel paradigm in which a sarm1-dependent mechanism contributes to Alzheimer's disease synapse loss. Sarm1 is a newly identified NAlzheimer's disease+ hydrolase enriched in axonal terminals, but its role in synapse degeneration in Alzheimer's disease is entirely unknown. We hypothesize that sarm1 plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease onset and progression by inducing axon and synapse degeneration. This hypothesis is formulated based on our preliminary data showing that sarm1 gene knockout significantly alleviates Alzheimer's disease mice's synaptic disruptions and cognitive dysfunction. We will evaluate this hypothesis using new mouse models, cognitive assays, biochemistry, electrophysiology, and super-resolution imaging. To this end, we have assembled an outstanding, interactive team of investigators with substantial expertise in synapse biology, neurocircuitry, mouse genetics, and Alzheimer's disease pathology. We propose three specific aims: 1) define the role of sarm1 in memory disruption and disease progression in Alzheimer's disease mice; 2) evaluate sarm1 function in axon and synapse degeneration in Alzheimer's disease brains; 3) illustrate molecular mechanisms of sarm1 action in the context of Alzheimer's disease pathology and its impact on β-amyloid pathology. Through the proposed work, we will test a fundamentally new concept essential to a long-standing question of Alzheimer's disease-synapse loss-and investigate sarm1-dependent signaling mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease-associated neurodegeneration. The results will advance the current knowledge on Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and provide critical insights into its novel treatments by targeting the sarm1 signaling pathway.

Individual cells also experience and respond to the flows in their environment. Flow responses regulate diverse processes such as blood pressure, bone density, and neural growth. This is particularly apparent in blood vessels, where a monolayer of endothelial cells forms the interface between flowing blood and stationary tissue. Correlation between regions of low flow and atherosclerotic plaques was observed a century ago, leading to the hypothesis that shear flow impacts endothelial cell function. Understanding how cells accomplish mechanotransduction of shear stress into cellular signals is of wide interest. However, the molecular determinants behind flow mechanotransduction remain unclear. Particularly, we lack information on the lateral movement of extracellular membrane proteins located at the cell-fluid interface. While flow has been observed to transport membrane proteins, how this transport affects protein function and cell responses remains unknown. The goal of the proposed studies is to quantitatively measure the physical interactions specific to lipid membranes that determine how lipids and proteins move in response to flow and test whether flow transport of a membrane protein activates intracellular signaling in endothelial cells. Our central hypothesis is that physiologically significant protein and lipid concentration gradients arise from physical interactions between fluid flow and complex membranes. This hypothesis is based on the premise that extracellular lipid-anchored proteoglycans like glypican-1 can be transported along the plasma membrane by external flow, with the aqueous part of the protein acting as a molecular sail. We will accomplish three specific aims: Our first aim is to identify the fundamental properties and principles that govern flow transport of membrane-linked proteins in model membranes and to build a model to predict protein motion in physiological contexts. In the second aim, we will determine how the flow-mediated lateral transport of a physiologically important membrane protein (glypican-1) initiates the short-term flow response in endothelial cells. In our third aim, we will investigate how lipid sorting by flow contributes to flow signaling in our model system and living cell membranes. Our approach is to conduct parallel experiments in model membranes and living cells, allowing us to directly relate physiological function to molecular biophysics. The experiments rely on the PI's expertise using experimental microfluidics and confocal microscopy to determine fundamental membrane properties. While the model protein studied here is specific to endothelial cells, the principles of fluid mechanics that we will uncover are universal. We, therefore, anticipate that our models will apply to multiple cell lines and flow conditions, and will lay the groundwork for future research directions.",5,5R01GM143320-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,7,2,0

In vertebrates, sudden and intense acoustic stimuli evoke an evolutionarily conserved startle response. While the execution of the acoustic startle response is extremely stereotyped, response probability is modulated in a context-dependent manner. For example, repeated presentation of a startling stimulus suppresses a behavioral response, representing a simple form of learning known as habituation. In humans, modulation of startle behavior is impaired in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including in Attention DeficitHyperactivity Disorder and autism spectrum disorders. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying startle modulation not well understood. Zebrafish show a remarkable behavioral plasticity, and we have previously shown that larvae exhibit modulation of the acoustic startle responseincluding prepulse inhibition and habituationwith behavioral and pharmacological characteristics similar to those in mammals. We previously conducted the first forward genetic screen in vertebrates to isolate mutants defective in startle modulation, and identified 14 mutants with defects in habituation behavior. None of these 14 mutants exhibit morphological defects or overt defects in startle performance. Importantly, five of the six mutants we cloned so far encode genes previously not implicated in vertebrate habituation. Here we propose to build on our success in using a molecular genetics, phenotype based strategy to decipher the molecular and circuits mechanisms that drive vertebrate habituation behavior. Specifically, rather than focusing on a single habituation gene, our strategy is to continue to use whole genome sequencing to clone six additional mutants from our screen. Combined with the six mutants we have already cloned, this provides an unparalleled toolbox critical to attain a comprehensive model of the molecular-genetic and circuit mechanisms underlying habituation. Simultaneously, we focus on select genes as entry points to further link genetic mutants to behavioral phenotypes and to decipher the molecular and circuit mechanisms that regulate behavior. The experiments in this proposal will:  use a molecular genetic approach including transgenic behavioral rescue to identify the neuronal populations in which three genes critical for habituation function;  to use molecular and pharmacogenetic approaches in conjunction with a behavioral assay to determine the signaling pathways through which the adaptor protein-2 sigma subunit (AP2s1) critical for receptor endocytosis and the huntingtin interacting gene hip14 promote habituation; and 3) to use an established whole genome sequencing/bioinformatics pipeline to identify the causative gene mutations for six additional habituation mutants isolated from our genetic screen, generate CRISPR/Cas9 alleles to confirm their identity and determine their expression in the brain. Combined this will provide both breadth and depth both at the molecular and at the circuit level critical to comprehensively address fundamental molecular genetic questions in vertebrate startle modulation, also relevant to human disease conditions.",5,5R01NS118921-09,PAS-18-483,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

New tools and paradigms are enabling deeper insights into the architectures and activities of these enzymatic assembly lines and are facilitating our long-term goal of applying the synthetic power of modular polyketide synthases to the development and production of new medicines. Using the updated definition of the ""module"", our lab has engineered diverse tri- /tetra-/pentaketide synthases that are functional both in vivo and in vitro. While these short assembly lines are uncommon in nature, they are ideal for our structural and functional studies. In Specific Aim 1 we propose to plunge-freeze these assembly lines as they are synthesizing their polyketide products and investigate them by cryo-electron microscopy. Since this approach has enabled us to capture high-resolution, dynamic information of the priming ketosynthase and acyltransferase of a model triketide synthase, we will apply it to synthases that contain other regions of interest. One objective is to learn how the ketoreductase, dehydratase, and enoylreductase processing enzymes are oriented relative to one another and the neighboring ketosynthase+acyltransferase didomains to understand how acyl carrier protein domains move between these enzymes during the extension and processing of polyketide intermediates. Thus, we will investigate at least thirteen engineered tri-/tetraketide synthases and two natural synthases functionally validated in our lab that contain different sets of these processing enzymes. In Specific Aim 2 we propose to elucidate interactions between processed polyketide intermediates and the ketosynthases that gatekeep for them. We have strong hypotheses for how sets of substrate tunnel residues interact with intermediates closest to the reactive thioester to ensure they are properly modified by upstream processing enzymes. Thus, we will appropriately mutate the gatekeeping residues of ketosynthases in less active model synthases as well as model synthases with inactivated upstream processing enzymes and determine whether their productivities improve as predicted. Since our data indicate that polyketide intermediates rigidify the ketosynthase dimer and dimeric ketosynthase+acyltransferase didomains can be readily identified in cryo-electron microscopy studies, we will also perform electron microscopy on stalled synthases to solve structures of polyketide-bound ketosynthase+acyltransferase dimers. In Specific Aim 3 we propose to determine key domain-domain interfaces. We have evidence that interfaces between processing enzymes and downstream KSs drive the ordered selfassembly of synthase polypeptides more than the small interface observed between the Cand N-terminal docking domains and seek structures of representative complexes. We also aim to determine how acyl carrier protein domains dock with ketosynthases during the transacylation reaction. If we are successful in these projects, it will greatly inform the rational engineering of modular polyketide synthases that synthesize new molecules and, ultimately, new medicines.",5,5R01GM106112-12,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

Over the past few years, major cancer genome sequencing studies have identified frequent inactivating mutations of mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex in over 25% of human cancers. Despite the prevalence of SWI/SNF mutations, the contributions of these alterations to tumorigenesis remain unclear. SMARCB1, a core subunit of the complex, was the first subunit linked to cancer when it was found to be recurrently mutated in almost all cases of malignant rhabdoid tumors (rhabdoid tumors). While studies using genetically engineered mouse models have firmly established SMARCB1 as a tumor suppressor, the epigenetic mechanism by which SMARCB1 mutation drives tumorigenesis remains elusive. The central hypothesis is that the biochemical diversity of the SWI/SNF complex composition determines its function in proper chromatin targeting to maintain discrete chromatin landscapes and transcriptional programs. Mutation of SMARCB1 leads to aberrant intraand inter-complex protein-protein interactions that influence chromatin targeting, which consequently alters chromatin landscapes and higher-order structures, and promote an oncogenic epigenome and transcriptome. The objective is to determine the role of SMARCB1 in SWI/SNF subcomplex formation and the impact of these dynamics on chromatin targeting and higher-order chromatin structure. Our ultimate goal is to determine the fundamental epigenetic mechanism(s) by which loss of this chromatin regulatory subunit drives rhabdoid tumor development. To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of cutting edge biochemical, molecular, and high-throughput sequencing technologies to move forward the program through the following specific aims: Aim 1, Determine SMARCB1 regulated SWI/SNF subcomplex assembly dynamics and identify SWI/SNF interactome in rhabdoid tumors; Aim 2, Determine the chromatin targeting activities of SWI/SNF subcomplexes and their relationship with other epigenetic regulators in rhabdoid tumors; Aim 3, Define higherorder chromatin structures regulated by the SWI/SNF complex in rhabdoid tumors.",5,5R01CA259850-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,10,4,4

The majority of virally suppressed individuals experience rapid viral rebound upon antiretroviral therapy interruption, providing a strong rationale for the development of cure strategies. Even in an antiretroviral therapy-suppressed HIV infection, chronic inflammation and immune activation are observed, along with limited CD4+T cell reconstitution, mucosal immune dysfunction, co-morbidities, and accelerated ageing. Low-grade persistent transcription and trickling production of viral proteins from the pool of integrated proviruses are believed to be partly responsible for these conditions. HIV eradication strategies such as shockand-kill have not been successful so far, and the pursuit of a functional cure or HIV remission has been thought as an alternative worth exploring. A functional cure entails long-term, durable control of viral expression in the absence of therapy, preventing disease progression and transmission, despite the presence of detectable integrated proviruses. Our group has been at the forefront of developing one such strategy, labeled the blockand-lock approach. The premise of this approach is that transcriptional inhibitors can mediate epigenetic silencing of proviral expression, locking the virus in a profound state of latency from which reactivation is very unlikely to occur upon antiretroviral therapy discontinuation. We have demonstrated this principle using the small molecule didehydro-Cortistatin A (didehydro-Cortistatin A) inhibitor of Tat, the key regulator of HIV transcriptional amplification. In in vitro and in humanized mouse models of HIV latency, didehydro-Cortistatin A inhibition of HIV transcription over time drives the viral promoter into deep transcriptional inhibition, limiting viral reactivation upon treatment interruption or with latency reactivating agents (LRAs)1-8. We believe that HIV transcriptional inhibitors, in general, have the potential to transform the way we treat HIV1 infections. Here we propose to investigate the potential of adding the transcriptional inhibitor didehydro-Cortistatin A to an antiretroviral therapy regimen in the rhesus macaque (rhesus macaque) model of SHIV infection. Not only is didehydro-Cortistatin A a new molecule that inhibits the activity of a viral target not yet clinically explored, but it also opens the possibility for exploration of novel approaches to fight HIV. Here we propose to: 1) determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of didehydro-Cortistatin A in antiretroviral therapytreated rhesus macaques; 2) understand the relationship between didehydro-Cortistatin A treatment and reduction in viral RNA in tissues, with the time to viral rebound upon treatment interruption; and 3) study the impact of didehydro-Cortistatin A as front-line therapy on the size of the established viral reservoir.",5,5R01AI167732-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

Prominent multi-level barriers interfere with HIV virologic suppression among sexual minority men living with HIV, particularly among those who use stimulants. We will digitally recruit at least 1,000 sexual minority men living with HIV, of whom at least 40% will identify as Black/African-American and at least 70% will have active stimulant use to identify multi-level determinants of HIV care engagement, adherence, and virologic suppression among sexual minority men living with HIV, with and without stimulant use. Guided by the social ecological model, we will investigate network factors (HIV status, stimulant use), geospatial determinants (background stimulant use prevalence, EHE region), and other structural factors (intersectional stigma, structural racism) that affect virologic suppression (Aim 1). After recruitment milestones are met, we will perform a nested randomized clinical trial to test a multi-component intervention to improve virologic suppression, adherence, positive affect, and stimulant use among sexual minority men living with HIV who use stimulants (n=300).

Of the ocular surface structures, the cornea is the most highly innervated tissue in the body. As such, dysfunction of the corneal/ocular surface nerves has been shown to underlie a wide range of diseases, including trauma, infections, metabolic imbalances, and therapeutic interventions such as refractive surgeries. Corneal diseases continue to be a major health problem in the US, and corneal nerve dysfunction contributes to many of these disorders, such as neurotrophic keratitis, corneal neuropathic pain, and dry eye disease (dry eye disease). dry eye disease alone has been shown to impact up to 75% of a given population, causing significant reduction in quality of life and increased risk for visually debilitating opacities. Therefore, a comprehensive characterization of corneal sensory nerves is critical for understanding the pathophysiology leading to ocular surface diseases. To meet this challenge and in response to the FOA RFA-EY-21-004 on ocular surface innervation, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team with a strong collaborative track record and complementary expertise, including eye disease models and wound healing (Lee); pain and the mammalian somatosensory system (Luo); intravital corneal nerve fiber imaging and regeneration (Rompolas); single-cell transcriptomics/epigenomics and related computational analyses (Wu); and neurophysiology and data analysis/machine learning (data analysis/machine learning). We propose to combine advanced imaging approaches, novel single-cell multi-omics, and cutting-edge mouse genetic models to perform three levels of analysis: 1) Morphology - using single neuron genetic labeling, we will resolve the fine morphology, spatial organization, and connectivity of corneal sensory neurons by visualizing axonal arborization in the cornea and brainstem/spinal cord. We will also examine interactions of individual sensory afferents and corneal epithelial cells. 2) Molecular - we will perform integrated single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics to interrogate the subtype-specific marker gene expression and epigenetic landscape of the corneal sensory neurons. 3) Functional - we will perform real-time physiologic analyses of corneal sensory afferents using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. To further elucidate the role of sensory nerves in ocular surface pathophysiology, we will determine how their morphology, molecular profile, and responsiveness are altered in a surgically induced dry eye disease model. Moreover, we will implement a novel high-speed imaging and machine learning platform to quantify evoked responses to corneal sensory stimuli and spontaneous behavior in the dry eye disease model. Taken together, our study will generate a comprehensive data set poised for integration that will fill in critical knowledge gaps in the field, create a robust foundation for future studies, and inform the development of more precise therapeutic strategies to treat ocular surface diseases.",5,5U01EY034681-03,RFA-EY-21-004,NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE,18,13,9,1

Unfortunately, owing to their flat and large interfaces, protein-protein interactions are challenging targets for traditional small molecule drugs. Cyclic peptides represent a promising solution to target protein-protein interactionsthey can directly mimic the binding functionalities at the protein-protein interactions and have enhanced biostability and bioavailability compared to their linear counterparts. However, there are only ~50 cyclic peptide drugs. Most are simply natural products or their derivatives, rather than deriving from successful de novo cyclic peptide development. A major reason why the design of novel, functional cyclic peptides has proven difficult is the need to simultaneously optimize multiple drug-related properties of cyclic peptides, e.g., binding affinity, water solubility, and membrane permeability. Because cyclic peptides often have ≤12 residues and are connected in a ring, even changing one amino acid can dramatically alter the properties of cyclic peptides. Hence, changing cyclic peptide sequences to optimize for one property often negatively impacts other properties. Machine learning (Machine learning), now widely used to build predictive models for drug properties, holds enormous potential to guide successful cyclic peptide design. Unfortunately, the few attempts at Machine learning models to predict cyclic peptide properties perform quite poorly. The core challenge is that most cyclic peptides, including the current cyclic peptide drugs, adopt multiple conformations in water. It is, therefore, difficult for Machine learning models to decipher how sequence modifications impact the complicated structural ensembles of cyclic peptides, which in turn influence their properties. If we can provide the Machine learning models with this missing structural information, we will greatly improve their performance in predicting cyclic peptide properties. Since no robust experimental methods are available to characterize and quantify the conformations in a cyclic peptide structural ensemble, computational chemistry represents a logical alternative. Although recent work has revealed that explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (molecular dynamics) simulation is capable of providing high-quality structural predictions of cyclic peptides, it is far too slow to be used at scale. On the other hand, computational methods that provide speedy predictions for cyclic peptide structural ensembles are inaccurate. Our long-term objective is a reliable, robust, and user-friendly platform for the computational design of potent, bioavailable cyclic peptides targeting protein-protein interactions. In our first aim, we use explicit-solvent molecular dynamics results of diverse sequences as training datasets to build novel Machine learning models that can predict cyclic peptide structural ensembles, preserving both accuracy and speed. In our second aim, we use these high-quality structural ensembles as a new descriptor for Machine learning inputs to enable the training of high-performing Machine learning models to predict cyclic peptide properties. In our third aim, we demonstrate that these new computational platforms allow us to develop potent cyclic peptide protein binders and PPI inhibitors.",5,5R01GM124160-07,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

The transition to independent breathing and accommodation of breathing interruptions, apneas, that are common in neonates and infants, requires a coordinated cardiorespiratory response for recovery. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, serotonin) and the brainstem raphe cells that produce it, referred to as Pet1 neurons, organize and drive successful autoresuscitatory reflex in newborn animals and humans. Unsuccessful autoresuscitatory reflex is understood to be a major contributor to the sudden infant death syndrome (sudden infant death syndrome), where alterations in the brain 5-HTergic system have been described in ~half of human sudden infant death syndrome cases, including increased number of 5-HT neurons of differing morphology (smaller, simpler, perhaps immature), deficiencies in autoreceptor 5-HT1A binding, and decreased levels of 5HT and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2, the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme for 5-HT). We propose investigations to reveal in mice how aspects of this sudden infant death syndrome brain 5-HTergic phenotype develop prenatally. Our approach is informed by two recent findings. First, Pet1+ neurons in the raphe expressing high levels of 5-HT identity genes (e.g. Ddc, Vmat2, Gata3, Pet1) have been identified, smaller in size, with modest levels of autoreceptor 5-HT1A yet remarkably expressing little or no TPH2 and 5-HT. We call these novel cells para-5HTergic neurons, signifying their partially shared molecular phenotype, shared location, and developmental emergence with 5-HT neurons. Second is the discovery of neurotransmitter switching, a noncanonical form of neuronal plasticity that occurs in response to stressors. Recent data support its role in shaping the 5-HTergic neuronal system, where stressors may drive some para-5-HT neurons to produce 5-HT as an adaptive response. Preliminary findings reveal that para-5-HT neurons derived from rhombomere (r) 4 densely and selectively innervate respiratory and arousal centers, and that gestational exposure to intermittent hypoxia results in an increased number of TPH2+ cells postnatally with as yet uncertain 5-HT levels. We propose that para-5-HT neurons are a pliant population that may be transformed when challenged prenatally by hypoxia to produce 5-HT in newborns as a compensatory mechanism to support autoresuscitatory reflex. We hypothesize that in response to the major sudden infant death syndrome risk factor of prenatal hypoxia, certain para-5-HT neurons adaptively transform to produce 5-HT to rectify a 5-HTergic signaling imbalance that hinders the autoresuscitatory reflex and, alternatively, that an insufficient transformation plays a critical role in sudden infant death syndrome. We will test this by exposing mice to intermittent hypoxia or normoxia during gestation, characterizing cellular and molecular phenotypes and querying neurotransmitter transformation (Aim 1); further, we will determine the effect of acute activation or inhibition of these r4-para-5-HT neurons on the autoresuscitatory reflex in these mice (Aim 2), and we will examine phenotypic markers of para-5-HT neurons in human sudden infant death syndrome and control brain tissue (Aim 3).

However, photoexcitation has rarely been considered in enzyme design. In recent years, it has been found that certain enzymes can be repurposed by photoexcitation for non-natural chemical reactions that cannot be easily achieved by smallmolecule catalysts or traditionally engineered enzymes. These enzymes, termed photoenzymes, are believed to utilize photoactivatable cofactors, combined with a natural or mutated enzyme scaffold, to reach new reaction spaces. Photoenzymes have emerged as a promising new class of catalysts for non-natural reactions important in pharmaceutical synthesis, such as asymmetric radical reactions important in late-stage functionalization of drug-like molecules. However, the mechanisms of photoenzymes have not been studied well and there has not been a clear rational discovery and design strategy for photoenzymes, not only because these are emergent systems, but also because existing computational methods are not adequate. In this research program, we will develop an integrated computational framework to predict the combined effect of light, cofactor, substrate(s), and protein sequences on photoenzyme reactivity and the mechanisms that lead to this effect, and will develop a physics-informed design strategy that makes use of descriptors derived from both ground and excited electronic states to control the activity and selectivity of photoenzymatic reactions. This will fill the gap in computational enzyme design where the excited electronic states are not normally considered. In specific, we will 1) develop machine learning-enhanced simulation methods to efficiently simulate both the ground and excited electronic states of photoenzymes to assist mechanistic studies and to inform the prediction and design of photoenzymes, and 2) develop a photoenzyme design strategy centered on descriptors derived from both ground and excited electronic states computed by molecular simulations.

The precise role they play in pathology is debated and impact could be mediated through antibody (antibody) production, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, or antigen presentation to T cells. To study antibodys produced by multiple sclerosis CSF B cell clones, we developed protocols to produce recombinant antibodies that duplicate the fidelity of CD138+ plasmablast clones expanded in the CSF compartment of early active multiple sclerosis patients. We identified a subset of antibodies that bound to myelin and induced complement-mediated oligodendrocyte cell death and demyelination in vivo. These lesions spontanelusly repair and have guided independent studies to investigate the role of microlgia in remyelination. Myelin-specific multiple sclerosis rantibodys bind to membrane lipid complexes anchored by the myelin protelopid 1 protein (protelopid 1 protein) that is enhanced by sulfatide and cholesterol. We have further identified a new pathogenic multiple sclerosis rantibody that binds myelin complexes independent of protelopid 1 protein, but still causes extensive oligodendrocyte loss and CNS demyelination. A semi-quantitiative CSF binding assay employing protelopid 1 protein protein, myelin glcyolipids and choleserol have identified antibodies to protelopid 1 protein complexes in approximately 60% of multiple sclerosis patients but not in inflammatory and neurologic disease control CSF. Hence, we hypothesize that pathogenic myelin-specific multiple sclerosis rantibodys encompass an array of epitope specificities targeting protelopid 1 protein protein, myelin glycolipids and protelopid 1 protein binding partners. We further suppose that antibodies to this complex contribute to type II multiple sclerosis lesions and represent a measurable and specific disease relevant response that can be quantified in patient CSF and serum. To test our hypothesis, we propose three complementary specific aims. In Aim 1, we will employ our quantitative protelopid 1 protein antibody binding assay to screen biobanked serum and CSF samples collected from clinically isolated syndrome (clinically isolated syndrome) patients, relapsing multiple sclerosis patients, progressive multiple sclerosis patients, and healthy and inflammatory controls to determine the prevalence of protelopid 1 protein antibodys across the multiple sclerosis disease spectrum and to correlate positive binding and titer to clinical correlates of disease activity.

It is now clear that mutations in genes encoding subunits of SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin-remodeling complexes are frequent, collectively occurring in over 20% of all cancers. Our group established SMARCB1 as a bona fide and potent tumor suppressor. We later made high-impact discoveries that helped define mechanisms by which SWI/SNF mutations lead to dysregulated cell proliferation. Our findings suggest a model whereby SWI/SNFfacilitated control of transcription underlies cellular fate specification, with disruption of this control being the basis for cancer formation. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the function of SWI/SNF complexes, to determine how their loss leads to oncogenesis, and to translate this knowledge into novel therapies. Based on our findings, we hypothesized that loss of SMARCB1, while driving cancer growth, also creates unique vulnerabilities. To identify such vulnerabilities, we collaborated with the Pediatric Dependencies Project to perform a rigorous genome-wide CRISPR deletion screen involving 21 rhabdoid tumor cell lines compared to over 800 other cancer cell lines. Notably, rhabdoid tumors are typically diploid and contain few other mutations, making them a powerful model with which to study the effects of gene deletions. We have now identified and validated a novel gene that is specifically essential for rhabdoid cell survival from this screen. Our preliminary data reveal that this gene's product, previously only linked to gene repression, has unanticipated connections with SWI/SNF and transcriptional activity. We localize this protein to enhancers and promoters of genes bound by SWI/SNF and hypothesize that this protein performs a key regulatory role in determining whether activating SWI/SNF complexes or repressive complexes are recruited, thus serving a pivotal role in dictating cell fate. We previously demonstrated that SWI/SNF and another repressive protein, EZH2, serve antagonistic roles in chromatin regulation, a discovery that ultimately led to FDA approval of an EZH2 inhibitor (EZH2 inhibitor) for SMARCB1-mutant cancers. Despite this success, the mechanisms that control the interplay between these complexes are poorly understood, as are the mechanisms that underlie resistance to EZH2 inhibitor in SWI/SNF-mutant cancers. To establish mechanisms driving drug resistance, we have performed a near genome-wide CRISPR screen in EZH2 inhibitor-treated rhabdoid tumors. We previously identified NSD1 as a gene that, when inactivated, causes resistance to EZH2 inhibitor. Here, we plan to investigate the mechanism of resistance conferred by mutations in a second chromatin regulatory gene not previously associated with SWI/SNF functions. Together, these experiments have the potential for broad impact including understanding the roles of these critical chromatin remodeling complexes in transcriptional control, in transformation, and as potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.",2,2R01CA172152-12,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Rotator cuff tears are associated with muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration (accrual of fat in the muscle bulk), non-homogenous distribution of fatty infiltration within the muscle, and reduced muscle strength and contractile function. Changes to muscle morphology likely have a negative effect on the muscle's architecture (number and organization of muscle fibers) and the mechanical properties dictating the muscle's overall force-generating capacity. However, little is known about the mechanisms linking muscle structure and function or how these associations change over time, exposing a notable knowledge gap. Establishing the structure-function associations of muscle after rotator cuff tear will expose the targets and key time points for design of treatments to improve outcomes for patients with a rotator cuff tear. Thus, the objective of this project is to determine the spatial and temporal changes to muscle morphology, architecture, and multi-scale mechanics after rotator cuff tear and surgical repair, and develop a predictive model to identify the mechanisms driving biomechanical function. To achieve this goal, longitudinal experimental assessments will be performed in an established rabbit model; a novel computational model will also be developed based on experimental structural measurements of muscle to further probe the mechanisms of muscle function. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) Establish the structure-function relationships of muscle after rotator cuff tear and surgical repair; and 2) Develop and test a predictive model to examine mechanisms driving reduced biomechanical function after rotator cuff tear. A rotator cuff tear will be surgically introduced in rabbits by blunt dissection of the supraspinatus tendon, with assessments at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after injury; surgical repair will be performed 8 weeks after injury, with a final assessment 8 weeks after repair. At each time point, muscle morphology and architecture, and intraversus extra-cellular location of lipid accumulation will be quantified using magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging). Multi-scale mechanics will be assessed at whole muscle and single fiber levels. Structure-function associations and how these associations change over time will be established. Structural measures of muscle morphology, architecture, and mechanics will be used to develop and test a predictive model to probe the mechanistic role of each structural parameter on biomechanical function. Models will be used to determine the mechanism and timing that should be targeted by treatment to improve functional outcomes. This work is significant because it will establish the structure-function relationship of muscle after rotator cuff tear and surgical repair and identify the mechanisms underpinning biomechanical function. Little work has examined both spatial and temporal changes to muscle structure and examined their influence on function, making this work innovative. Study outcomes will expand our understanding of the impact of rotator cuff tear and drive development of novel treatments for the rotator cuff tear patient population.",5,5R01AR079999-02,PAR-21-038,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASES,15,2,0,0

Physical inactivity is a modifiable cancer risk factor; physical activity (physical activity) is associated with risk reductions between 10-20% for breast, colon, and 6 other cancers. Further, rural residents report approximately 24% lower physical activity compared to urban residents. Primary care providers are a trusted source of health advice and they are in an ideal position to assess physical activity and advise propose a multi-level group randomized trial, including provider advices regarding becoming and staying physically active. It is estimated that 84.3% of adults had an appointment with a primary health care professional in 2018. Thus, primary care encounters provide an opportunity to promote physical activity among the majority of rural adults, particularly among those with chronic disease profiles placing them at elevated cancer risk (e.g., overweight, obesity, diabetes). There is substantial evidence demonstrating the success of primary care providers promoting physical activity. Advice from providers is most effective in creating sustainable increases in physical activity when followed by phone or community PA opportunities and programs-based support. The first challenge to implementing this type of approach in rural settings is the need for a methodology to train rural primary care providers to promote physical activity. We propose to apply the well validated ECHO Model to train providers toward the goal of communicating the health benefits of physical activity to propose a multi-level group randomized trial, including provider advices, making clear recommendations, and connecting them to physical activity resources. Additional challenges to promoting physical activity in rural residents are provision of behavioral support and ensuring adequate opportunities for physical activity. These activities are beyond the scope of practice for primary care providers. We propose to partner with the Harrisburg YMCA to create a 'MoveLine' - logistically, the physical activity equivalent to the highly successful smoking cessation 'QuitLine'. Providers will refer propose a multi-level group randomized trial, including provider advices to the MoveLine, who will then counsel and connect propose a multi-level group randomized trial, including provider advices to physical activity options available in their communities. Study staff and a community PA opportunities and programs advisory board (community PA opportunities and programs advisory board), in collaboration with the YMCA, Penn State Extension, and Penn State (PSU) faculty will work to identify existing physical activity options and to expand them as well. While intervening on the built environment is beyond the scope of this application, we acknowledge the import of environment on physical activity by rigorously evaluating its impact on outcomes. We propose a multi-level group randomized trial, including provider advice (propose a multi-level group randomized trial, including provider advice), coaching and MoveLine (propose a multi-level group randomized trial, including provider advice, social), and educating and promoting community PA opportunities and programs physical activity opportunities and programs (community PA opportunities and programs). We also evaluate the impact of the built environment on physical activity outcomes. We propose this work in collaboration with the Primary Health Network (8 Federally Qualified Health Clinics serving rural Pennsylvania), Penn State Health (8 clinics serving rural Pennsylvania), the Harrisburg YMCA, and Penn State Extension to increase physical activity levels in rural Pennsylvanians, toward the goal of reducing cancer risk. A total of 16 clinics will be randomized to the immediate or delayed treatment condition (2-3 providers nested within each clinic and 20 propose a multi-level group randomized trial, including provider advices nested within each provider; 800 propose a multi-level group randomized trial, including provider advices in total).",5,5R01CA268017-03,RFA-CA-20-051,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,1,3,3,2

For highly vulnerable groups like adolescent girls and young women (adolescent girls and young women) in sub-Saharan Africa, access and uptake of vaccines will be essential for reducing the exceptionally high HIV incidence observed in recent years. This is particularly true in South Africa, which has the world's largest HIV epidemic and several active HIV vaccine trial programs. While an HIV vaccine has the potential to substantially reduce HIV risk, realizing this potential will require widespread vaccine uptake. Unfortunately, the lived experiences of both the HIV epidemic and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have laid the groundwork for an infodemic of misinformation about the HIV vaccine. Likely attributes of the HIV vaccine (e.g., partial protection against HIV), low trust in governmental and medical research institutions, and poor understanding of how vaccines work will leave an HIV vaccine program vulnerable to misinformation among the populations who would most benefit from vaccine-induced protection. To realize the benefits of future HIV vaccines, novel communication strategies are needed to ""inoculate"" individuals at highest risk of HIV infection against contagious vaccine misinformation. In this study, we bring together two promising approaches - psychological inoculation theory and behavioral economics - to fight HIV vaccine misinformation. Psychological inoculation theory offers a compelling approach to building ""resistance"" to vaccine misinformation through explicit exposure to a ""weakened"" version (via direct refutation) of false arguments underlying misinformation, before stronger versions of misinformation are encountered. Importantly, by posits debunking prebunking (or pre-emptively warning individuals about) emerging misinformation, inoculation theory also that t hey will be better able to r esist future misinformation. Prebunking avoids the greater challenge of once misinformation has lodged. In addition, behavioral economics provides a complementary framework that recognize the cognitive and attentional constraints faced by individuals and can inform more effective inoculation messages. We propose a randomized controlled trial of inoculation messages with a behavioral economics ""boost"" with adolescent girls and young women in South Africa, a population highly vulnerable to both HIV infection and to vaccine misinformation. Mirroring a vaccine trial, our behavioral trial will evaluate the efficacy, safety, durability, and generalized immunity effects of inoculation messages that are boosted with behavioral economics insights. We will also evaluate differential responses to the messages by important subgroups of adolescent girls and young women. This proof--of-concept project has the potential to identify innovative communication strategies to build resistance to emerging and evolving HIV vaccine misinformation. Results from the study will advance the science of HIV vaccine demand creation and inoculation-theory based approaches to vaccine communication.",5,5R01MH132401-02,RFA-MH-22-170,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,6,5,3,2

About one-third of the patients have seizures resistant to anti-epileptic medication and therefore, an alternative treatment is necessary. Recent studies show that neurons can be recruited and seizures can propagate by a mechanism known as electric field coupling. Our laboratory has shown that canceling the electric field in the extracellular space can prevent neural propagation and recruitment. We now propose to develop a novel neurotechnology that not only can control the propagation of seizures but prevent the seizure from being generated by controlling the extracellular electric field. With a combined methodology of in-vitro electrophysiology with state-of-the-art neural imaging, computer modeling and in-vivo preparations in rodents, we will implement the seizure control system and study its mechanism with four specific aims: 1) Prevent neuronal synchronization in hyperexcitable neural tissue, 2) Develop a novel technology of extracellular voltage clamp to control seizures in-vivo, 3) Determine the mechanisms of seizure control by an extracellular voltage clamp system, 4) Determine the role of the extracellular space in the clamping efficiency. Current electrical responsive control therapy detects a seizure and then applies stimulation. The proposed neurotechnology will prevent the synchronization between neurons to stop the generation of seizures before they arise at very low current amplitude thereby providing a novel therapeutic paradigm for treating epilepsy.",5,5R01NS121084-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,2,1,5,1

Furthermore, we have evidence that the TNF Superfamily LIGHT decreases airway remodeling and will address how LIGHT blockade compares to neutrophilic depletion, or IL17 neutralization, in decreasing NA symptoms: airway resistance, epithelial damage, fibroblasts activation, and neutrophil recruitment.

But determining how much of the association is causal is challenging. The gold standard for determining causality is prospective random assignment of treatment, but practical and ethical considerations often make it hard to award money or equivalent resources in a truly random way. Thus, researchers have used longitudinal studies of parents' income and children's health or exogenous changes in social and fiscal policy to show that additional money lowers mortality. But studies with true randomization-lottery winners and people randomly given different levels of health insurance-show more modest influences of money on mortality. This study produces the first ever estimates of how randomly awarded wealth affects mortality over a lifetime of follow-up in two generations, for both men and women, and constructs a policy relevant metric of the incremental wealth required for an additional year of life expectancy. The project analyzes the long-term implications of a major land redistribution policy in New Zealand in which low interest loans for farms were awarded by lottery. Program terms ensured applicants were of similar economic status, and the policy operated like a true random experiment. Loan terms were similar to modern mortgages: low annual payments over a long term. Documents show randomization was adhered to for over 20 years. New Zealand's universal, centralized death registration facilitates construction of a matched intergenerational sample of lottery winners and losers and their children. Ninety percent of applicants can be linked to death records, which is a significantly higher linkage rate than can be obtained in the US. These estimates will be a lower bound on how much money matters for health because New Zealand had low inequality, high life expectancy, and the subjects were born in an era when infectious disease was an important cause of death. This R21 project has four aims: 1) estimate the causal effects of winning land on lottery participants' mortality, 2) estimate the causal effects of winning land on the mortality of children of lottery participants, 3) estimate gender differences in the effects of wealth on mortality, and 4) identify potential mechanisms that contributed to life expectancy differences. The study design combines the inferential strengths of true random assignment in a block design with additional contrasts between children born before and after their parents participated in the lottery to identify effects of wealth on mortality in two generations. Contrasts in effect sizes by sex, birth order, and generation are used to identify potential causal mechanisms. Causal mediation analysis of early adult health measures, mid-life occupational status, urban or rural residence, and lifetime wealth accumulation illuminate potential pathways between wealth and reduced mortality. The proposed research, with a credible causal identification strategy and lifetime follow-up, will contribute significantly to knowledge of how money and social status affect health, aging, and mortality.",5,5R21AG077099-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,1,3,3,2

While the use of cancer cell-based models are typical for drug discovery, using these cells to simulate non-cancer diseases is inaccurate and can alter the drug discovery process. Thus, scientists have been transitioning to primary cells derived from patient Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells) for drug screening. Working with cellular models derived from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells involves fixing the cells to perform immunofluorescent staining for analysis of targets of interest, which unfortunately does not permit meaningful live-cell studies. While techniques are available for developing Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells with genomic modifications via CRISPR (for tracking endogenous drug targets) that allow for live-cell analysis, these processes are highly laborious and inefficient. Here we propose developing novel genetic tools, in combination with CRISPR for genome editing, to rapidly add reporter tags in up to three target genes in Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells cells. This will dramatically improve drug discovery with live-cell high-content confocal microscopy. We will use our FASTHDR vector system (patented), in combination with CRISPR, to enhance the process of genome editing in Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells cells. Our methodology is validated with cancer cell lines, and recent preliminary data indicates that our techniques can work with Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. Thus the challenge presented in the current application is to adapt our methodology to work seamlessly with Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells cells and to create novel vectors that will facilitate the modification of genes that are not actively expressed in the stem cell state.

Due to enhanced screening, KM-LUAD is increasingly being detected at earlier pathological stages, thus posing a growing public health burden that warrants improved early treatment. Despite this urgency, early changes that conceive KM-LUAD and that would thus likely comprise ideal targets for interception remain poorly characterized. Previously, our group and others have shown that tobacco exposure leads to a pervasive field of injury that is composed of molecular (e.g., KRAS mutations) and inflammatory changes in normal-appearing epithelium and in the lung, and that are prevalent in the lung adenocarcinomas themselves. We and others have also previously described molecular and immune changes, including a decrement in host immunity, that are associated with development of lung premalignant lesions (premalignant lesions) and KM-LUAD. These earlier studies have shed light on events that are likely implicated in early lung tumor development. Yet, especially for a cancer like KM-LUAD that is causally related to smoking, the identity and properties of specific cell populations that trigger a field of injury as well as its progression to PML and KMLUAD are not known. In our preliminary efforts, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of lung tissues from a human-relevant mouse model of tobacco-associated KM-LUAD. We found a population of Krt8+ alveolar cells (Krt8+ alveolar cells) that was greatly increased early on in lungs exposed to tobacco carcinogen but not control saline and that were also associated with tumor cell onset. Krt8+ alveolar cells displayed intriguing properties that allow us to surmise that they perhaps represent KM-LUAD progenitors: they amassed the same driver Kras mutations found in the resultant lung adenocarcinomas; they expressed transcriptomic programs and cell-cell interactions that are highly pertinent to KM-LUAD including augmented p53 as well as pro-inflammatory IL-1β and NF-κB signaling; and their expression profiles were highly enriched in human premalignant lesions and lung adenocarcinomas. We also found that Krt8+ alveolar cells were markedly increased in the human LUAD ecosystem relative to matched normal lung. Our preliminary findings motivate the hypothesis that oncogenesis of Krt8+ alveolar cells in concert with pro-inflammatory signaling mediated by IL-1β/NF-κB underlie initiation and development of PML and KM-LUAD. To address our hypothesis we will 1) characterize at single-cell resolution evolution of Krt8+ alveolar cells to PML and KM-LUAD, as well as determine the role of p53 signaling in this process; 2) discern the role of pro-inflammatory signaling in promoting evolution of Krt8+ alveolar cells to PML and KM-LUAD; and 3) use multiple approaches including drug screening to determine whether targeting Krt8+ alveolar cells will intercept PML and KM-LUAD development. At the conclusion of our studies, we will have unraveled novel paths in the phenotypic evolution of KM-LUAD as well as laid the foundation for development of new strategies that inhibit the inception of this dire malignancy.",5,5R01CA272863-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

The diverse biophysical characteristics, topology, posttranslational modifications, and activities of these membrane proteins necessitate distinct cellular pathways and numerous components to ensure their proper biogenesis and function. The goal of this project is to define a new mechanistic role of the zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24 in membrane protein biology. ZMPSTE24 has long been a research focus in my laboratory and is important for human health and longevity through its established role in the proteolytic processing of farnesylated prelamin A, precursor of the nuclear scaffold protein lamin A. Defects in this processing step lead to premature aging (progeria) diseases. However, an intriguing new function for ZMPSTE24 in viral defense was recently discovered by others and surprisingly does not require its catalytic activity: ZMPSTE24 confers potent antiviral activity against many enveloped viruses through its interaction with a class of small membrane proteins called interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM1, 2, and 3). The IFITMs block virus-host cell fusion by a mechanism that involves ""rigidifying"" host cell membranes. As is the case for IFITMs, the overexpression of ZMPSTE24 robustly protects cells from infection by enveloped viruses, and its proteolytic activity is not needed in this role. Furthermore, depletion of ZMPSTE24 in cells and mice cause them to succumb to viral infection. These findings place ZMPSTE24 at an important position in the cell's first line of defense against viral infection, likely through a general cell biological role. Here we hypothesize that ZMPSTE24 defines a central component in a known or new pathway for membrane protein biogenesis (insertion, topology, stability/quality control, posttranslational modification, or oligomerization), with IFITM3 as its substrate. Alternatively, ZMPSTE24 may facilitate IFITM3's membrane rigidifying function in some other way, directly by recruitment to IFITM3, or indirectly by altering the composition or properties of the lipid bilayer. This project represents an exciting new direction in my laboratory's long-term studies of ZMPSTE24, inspired by the convergence of ZMPSTE24's newly discovered role in viral defense and the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the studies we propose also relate to earlier research in my laboratory on membrane protein topology, trafficking, and endoplasmic reticulum quality control. Deciphering the antiviral role of ZMPSTE24 via the IFITMs presents an intriguing puzzle that we are primed to solve. We expect the studies proposed here will uncover a new fundamental role(s) for ZMPSTE24 in membrane protein biogenesis or membrane lipid composition or fluidity. Furthermore, insight into the mechanism whereby ZMPSTE24 enables IFITMs to block virus-host-cell fusion could ultimately be harnessed to develop a novel anti-viral drug.",5,5R35GM127073-07,PAR-19-367,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,9,11,1,3

This gap is a critical barrier to developing T2DM prevention and management interventions for reducing vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia). Hyperglycemia increasingly develops in younger adults and may impair their cognition. The central hypothesis is that higher cumulative hyperglycemia levels over the life course and suboptimal T2DM management contribute to faster cognitive decline and higher and related dementias risk. Guided by robust preliminary data, the team will test this hypothesis using 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will quantify the influence of cumulative hyperglycemia from young adulthood to late life on cognitive trajectories and and related dementias in adults with and without T2DM, and explore how sex, race, and hyperglycemia duration affect these relationships. Aim 2 will determine the impact of T2DM management (cumulative hemoglobin A1c levels) on cognitive trajectories in adults with T2DM, and explore how sex, race, and T2DM duration affect these relationships. Aim 3 will identify potential mechanisms for T2DM-related and related dementias. It will clarify the relationships between cumulative hyperglycemia and magnetic resonance imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease in adults with and without T2DM, determine how much cerebral small vessel disease burden explains associations between cumulative hyperglycemia levels and cognitive decline and incident and related dementias, and explore the role of stroke. Aims 1 and 3 will use pooled cohort studies to measure the effects of glycemia and other vascular risk factors, cerebral small vessel disease, and stroke on and related dementias risk. Aim 2 will use an individual participant data meta-analysis of 3 trials to quantify the effects of T2DM management and control of other vascular risk factors on cognitive trajectories. The multi-disciplinary research team has the proper expertise and a strong record of executing multicenter pooled cohort studies of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia. The study is innovative because it includes young adults and those with prediabetes, and it will create new pooled datasets with unprecedented size and diversity in age, sex, geography, race, ethnicity, and hyperglycemia duration for vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia research. Aims 1 and 2 will provide crucial evidence on optimal control of glycemia and other vascular risk factors to reduce and related dementias risk in people with T2DM and prediabetes, especially in younger adults. Aim 3 will identify potential mechanisms for vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia interventions. The study is significant because it will generate empirical evidence to guide future trials, shared decision-making in clinical practice, clinical guidelines, and health policies to preserve cognitive health and prevent vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia in adults with hyperglycemia.

Despite this, pharmacotherapeutics for the treatment of withdrawal are lacking, at least in part, due to poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying symptoms of withdrawal. The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (rostromedial tegmental nucleus) is a GABAergic region that exerts inhibitory control over midbrain bioaminergic and cholinergic nuclei. Recently, work from our lab revealed significantly enhanced cFos expression, a marker of recent neuronal activity, in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus of chronic intermittent ethanol (chronic intermittent ethanol) exposed rats 12 hours into acute withdrawal. In addition, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of the rostromedial tegmental nucleus attenuates withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior. However, the precise neural circuits that drive this putative rostromedial tegmental nucleus hyperactivity is unknown. The lateral habenula (lateral habenula) provides dense glutamatergic input to the rostromedial tegmental nucleus and exhibits significant functional overlap with the rostromedial tegmental nucleus. In addition, our preliminary data reveals a significant increase in cFos expression in rostromedial tegmental nucleus-projecting lateral habenula (lateral habenula) neurons during acute withdrawal. Together, these data lead us to hypothesize that lateral habenula inputs to the rostromedial tegmental nucleus play a mechanistic role in regulating symptoms of withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure. Experiments in the current proposal are designed to test this hypothesis by using in vivo chemogenetics to bidirectionally and selectively manipulate lateral habenula-rostromedial tegmental nucleus activity during behavioral tests of withdrawal symptoms including anxiety-like behavior, mechanical pain sensitivity, and impulsive choice.

Findings from these experiments will shed new light onto the role of this neural circuit in regulating symptoms of withdrawal and by extension have the potential to uncover new neurobiological targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.",5,5R01AA031003-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM,0,1,8,1
11057384,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/Ef84L9ttlUCNlHK2F9ixOw/project-details/11057384#similar-Projects,Pre-clinical testing of a novel gene therapy for pediatric neurodegenerative disease,"A significant number of pediatric neuromuscular and neurodegenerative conditions are caused by recessive gene mutations resulting in loss of both maternal and paternal copies of a gene. These genes may encode for proteins that play critical roles in cell differentiation, cell survival, and/or cell function(s). Current medical management strategies attempt to delay disease progression or minimize symptoms of these conditions, yet they do not address the underlying genetic deficiency. Gene replacement therapy is a treatment approach that provides back to cells a functional copy of a gene, thereby overcoming the deficiency caused by genetic mutations and permanently rescuing cell differentiation, survival, and/or function to a degree that the disease is halted or prevented entirely. This approach utilizes an AAV9 virus to deliver functional copies of a gene to cells of interest based, in part, on how the therapy is administered. Gene therapies have potential to revolutionize treatment of pediatric diseases, as was demonstrated recently by the FDA approval of a gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy. As part of this study, we are testing a novel gene therapy for childhood-onset striatonigral degeneration, a severe progressive neurologic disease caused by recessive mutations in the VAC14 gene. Patients with this condition develop signs of neurodegeneration in the first half-decade of life that progresses rapidly and results in severe neurologic and neuromuscular deficit that is not responsive to current medical treatments. To study this further, we engineered the first viable pre-clinical mouse model of this condition (termed Vac14ducky). Vac14ducky mice develop neurologic disease associated with accumulation of vacuoles within the brain cortex, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia. The vacuolization observed in Vac14ducky mice is similar to vacuole formation previously demonstrated in patient-derived fibroblasts. We developed a novel gene therapy product (AAV9-hVAC14opt) expressing the human VAC14 gene transcript, and using our novel Vac14ducky mice, we performed preliminary in vivo efficacy and toxicology evaluations. Following a single intrathecal injection at 7 days of age, our results thus far demonstrate that AAV9-hVAC14opt successfully rescues overall health and motor function in adult Vac14ducky mice. Additionally when treating control mice, AAV9-hVAC14opt showed no detectable toxicities. These preliminary results suggest AAV9-hVAC14opt is a potential novel gene therapy for the pediatric VAC14-associated neurodegenerative disease. The study proposed here will test a dose-response that is required for an IND application. Aim 1 determines the minimal effective dose of AAV9-hVAC14opt needed to provide therapeutic benefit in Vac14ducky mice as well as in the more severe mouse line Vac14ingls. Aim 2 tests the post-symptomatic treatment efficacy utilizing Vac14ducky mice as well as Vac14ingls mice. The complementary Aims of this proposal will provide critical evidence demonstrating AAV9-hVAC14opt as a novel gene therapy for this severe pediatric condition. At the completion of this study, we will be prepared to proceed toward an IND application for eventual testing in patients.",1,1R21NS137243-01A1,PA-21-219,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,2,6,6,1

Subtherapeutic engraftment occurs even under full myeloablative conditioning and will likely become an even bigger issue with nonmyeloablative and nongenotoxic conditioning. The only corrective measure for subtherapeutic correction levels is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which subjects patients to the risks of graftversus-host disease. Here we propose an alternative, minimally toxic approach to increase engraftment of gene-modified cells into the therapeutic range that avoids the significant side-effects associated with myeloablative conditioning and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Our approach will be applied to sickle cell disease (sickle cell disease) and ß-thalassemia, which represent the most common severe monogenic diseases worldwide. Gene replacement therapies for these disorders have shown promising early results but also in many cases subtherapeutic gene-correction levels. In this application, we propose an innovative strategy to enrich genomeedited and therapeutically relevant hematopoietic stem cell post-transplantation in the context of reduced, nonmyeloablative conditioning. This strategy relies on three coordinated aims that collectively address current hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy/genome editing transplantation. Specific Aim 1 will optimize safety and efficacy of novel base editors/prime editors to allow simultaneous modification of the therapeutic globin target and of the selection gene. Specific Aim 2 will apply these novel editing tools to the modification of hematopoietic stem cells derived from both healthy or sickle cell patients in order to support high levels of therapeutic globin production upon engraftment and drug selection in the mouse xenograft model. Specific Aim 3 will build upon these findings to evaluate engraftment and selection protocols for edited hematopoietic stem cell in the clinically relevant rhesus macaque autologous transplant model in the setting of reduced-intensity conditioning. To accomplish these aims, we assembled a multidisciplinary team which includes investigators with complementary expertise in base editing/prime editing (Dr. Liu), hemoglobinopathies (Dr. Weiss) and hematopoietic stem cell biology and transplantation (Dr. Kiem). Our findings should be applicable to other diseases in which genetically corrected cells do not have a natural selective advantage and also to other reduced-intensity, nongenotoxic conditioning regimens. Collectively, the proposed studies will define a safer and effective hematopoietic stem cells transplantation protocol that will serve as a foundation for clinical testing in patients suffering from hemoglobinopathies and from other genetic diseases.",5,5R01HL136135-09,PA-19-056,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",3,4,0,3

The general goal of this program is to develop new synthetic chemistry platforms that will enable the rapid and selective construction of new structures of immediate relevance for biomedical applications. Key challenges that we seek to address in the coming project period include: • Enantioconvergent reactions: A significant expansion of general strategies and reaction platforms that catalytically convert readily accessible racemic starting materials into high value, enantiomerically enriched products; • Salt-based catalysis: The development of broad new catalysis modes that operate by quasiintramolecular mechanisms enabled by ionic tethering; • Dearomatization of feedstock arenes: The development of useful oxidative dearomatization reactions that convert readily available aromatic building blocks into functionalized enantiomerically pure building blocks; • Natural product synthesis: The efficient synthesis and biological evaluation of complex natural products and new structural analogs. Collectively, we expect that these MIRA research activities will provide facile access to structures that were heretofore unknown or accessible only by virtue of methods that were inefficient and/or impractical.

Therefore, an understanding of the basic circuit neurobiology and neuromodulation of feature-based visual perception will sharpen our understanding of the mechanism of visual processing, and should facilitate the development of treatments for these disabilities. One form of visual attention is targeted to salient features of the visual scene, during which a subject detects optical disparities that distinguish a salient object from the cluttered visual surroundings. The cell-circuit mechanism for how this occurs is not well understood. This renewal project will capitalize on recent discoveries and significant experimental advantages of the fruit fly Drosophila to explore the elementary neural circuitry required for feature-based visual attention. The fly has a numerically simple nervous system, with which highly advanced genetic techniques can be used to identify, manipulate, and repeatedly record the activity of individual neurons, as well as their upstream and downstream network partners. The fly also displays robust feature-based visual perception, even under stimulus conditions that defeat classical models of motion vision, for which similar processes have been localized to cortical pathways in humans and non-human primates. The PI hypothesizes that flies detect and discriminate the higher-order features of visual objects with specialized circuits that integrate first-order elementary motion signals retinotopically, which are further enhanced by the action of inhibitory neurotransmitters. The PI will perform two-photon Ca2+ imaging of candidate cellular pathways in response to stimuli the PI has discovered to elicit robust feature detection by flies within a virtual reality flight simulator. Armed with physiological receptive fields, the PI will use live imaging to 'read' and optogenetics to 'write' activity patterns in a behaving fly to directly observe input-output functions of feature detection processing on visual behavior. Finally, the PI will study how biogenic amines modulate the functional properties of feature detecting neurons to enable plasticity required for visual feature detection in switching behavioral contexts such as the transition from stationary quiescence to active locomotion.",5,5R01EY026031-08,PA-20-185,NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE,0,1,5,1

A major function of the brain is to integrate information across sensory modalities to enable sharp and robust perception. The cell-circuit mechanism for how different sensory modalities interact is not well understood. This project will capitalize on the significant experimental advantages of the fruit fly Drosophila to explore the molecular logic and neural connections that produce an elementary form of multisensory integration perception. The fly displays robust multisensory perception, integrating olfactory signals with visual processing to enhance perceptual abilities. Furthermore, sensory circuits have been shown to be under robust neuromodulatory control by biogenic amines.

With the development and improvement of combination antiretroviral therapies (combination antiretroviral therapies) there was a substantial decrease of the death and morbidity rates of people living with HIV/AIDS. HIV associated neurocognitive disorders and neuroinflammation are exacerbated by Methamphetamineamphetamine (Methamphetamine) abuse. people living with HIV/AIDS abusing Methamphetamine present a high prevalence of chronic neuroinflammation and the cellular mechanism(s) that drive such inflammation have not been entirely defined. Certain models of neuroinflammation define inter-cellular cytokine signaling as a major player in neuroinflammation. These models propose that activation of microglia results in the production of inflammatory cytokines and metabolites that are recognized by astrocytes, leading to a modification from non-reactive astrocytes to a range of pro-inflammatory or repair phenotypes. In this proposal we aim to identify the molecular mechanisms that trigger the activation of intracellular innate immunity in microglia and astrocytes in the context of NeuroHIV and Methamphetamine, and characterize the cellular crosstalk between HIV infected and non-infected brain cells under physiological concentrations of combination antiretroviral therapies. Our preliminary data from gene expression and microscopy of innate sensing immune complexes points to an activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes ((cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes) pathway in microglia with Methamphetamine and HIV infection. Thus, we hypothesize that HIV-triggered activation of the cGAS/(cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes pathway leads to episodes of chronic neuroinflamation. We also hypothesize that Methamphetamine-mediated DNA damage is additive to the activation of the inflammation pathway. In the R61 phase, we aim to determine the impact of HIV post-entry events and Methamphetamine-mediated DNA damage on innate immune sensing of glial cells. During the R33 phase, we will characterize the biological consequences of HIV/Methamphetamine-mediated innate sensing to brain organoids under brain physiologic combination antiretroviral therapies concentrations. We aim to assess the potential of cGAS/(cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes antagonists to reduce neuroinflammation in the context of HIV/Methamphetamine. We will carry out an experimental plan using functional assays, cyclic multiplex immunofluorescence and super-resolution fluorescence imaging, machine learning analysis, next-generation sequencing, and multiplexed cytokine profiling in iPSC-derived microglia, astrocytes, cerebral brain organoids and a chimeric human/mouse animal model. These studies will define the activation of HIV/Methamphetamine-mediated innate immunity in cells from the brain that are known to be infected by HIV and the impact of this activation in the disruption of normal brain homeostasis by inflammatory processes. At the heart of this proposal is the clarification and identification of the mechanism(s) that drive and/or contribute to persistent neuroinflammation by HIV and Methamphetamine under combination antiretroviral therapies that culminate in HIV associated neurocognitive disorders.

Due to limited regenerative potential, these injuries are complicated by slow and imperfect healing. In order to develop therapies to improve healing outcomes, it is important to understand the mechanisms regulating adult tendon cells during homeostasis and healing. Tendon-derived stem/progenitor cells have been identified in vitro and display stem/progenitor characteristics, including clonogenicity, multilineage differentiation potential, and self-renewal. However, the identity and activity of resident progenitor populations in the adult tendon are not well understood. We have identified an adult tendon cell marked by Axin2-CreERt2 that displays progenitor-like activities in vitro and in vivo. After tendon injury, Axin2+ cells proliferate, infiltrate the injury site, and express Scx-GFP. In addition, we find their injury response is dependent upon the Wnt pathway. We propose to use lineage tracing, genetic loss of function, and next generation sequencing techniques to gain a mechanistic understanding of Axin2+ cells in the adult tendon during homeostasis and healing. We will test the hypothesis that Axin2+ cells are a unique tendon cell population that, through Wnt secretion and response, are key orchestrators of tendon healing. First, we will test the function of Wnt signaling in maintaining Axin2+ progenitor cell identity during homeostasis. Next, we will define the function of Wnt secretion and canonical Wnt signaling in regulating Axin2 cell injury response at early and later stages of tendon healing. We will also test if activation of canonical Wnt signaling promotes Axin2+ cell identities and injury response, leading to improved healing outcomes. A mechanistic understanding of Axin2+ cell function is an integral step towards expanding our fundamental understanding of adult tendon biology.

This may be due solely to the HIV-1 infection; however, this may also indicate that prolonged antiretroviral therapy itself may contribute to the impairments, particularly in the context of HIV-1 infection. The latter possibility is of particular concern given that a growing number of uninfected individuals use antiretrovirals (antiretrovirals) as preexposure prophylaxis (preexposure prophylaxis). The brain circuitry that may be affected by prolonged treatment with antiretrovirals or by antiretrovirals in the context of HIV-1 infection is unknown. We propose to apply our recently developed array of new tools for constructing, comparing, and analyzing 3D whole-brain maps of neuronal activation in the mouse brain to reveal the critical neural circuitry affected by antiretrovirals, HIV-1 infection, and their combination. Our hypothesis is that 3D patterns of neuronal activation in animals exposed to antiretrovirals, HIV-1, and ARV/HIV-1 and involved in challenging behavioral tasks can both reveal the crucial circuitry defining these effects and serve as unique signatures of the treatments' effects. In specific aim 1, we will determine the critical shared components of neural circuitry affected by prolonged exposure to select antiretrovirals. We will generate mesoscopic global maps of neuronal activation in mice presented with relevant cognitive challenges after exposure to antiretrovirals. We will then subject the mapping datasets to our stepwise selection pipeline to identify the critical brain regions and neural circuits altered by the treatments. In specific aim 2, we will determine the components of neural circuitry in NOD-hIL-34 mice, a humanized animal model of HIV-1 infection, that are affected by exposure to select antiretrovirals in the context of infection. Finally, in specific aim 3, we will validate and extend the conclusions of our in silico investigations: we will monitor neuronal activity in the candidate regions in vivo on the single-cell and population levels; apply monosynaptic tracing to determine whether ARV treatment induces long-term changes in neuronal connections; and use chemogenetics to manipulate neuronal activity in the key components of the inferred circuitry. Our experiments will create a circuitry map space for the action of antiretrovirals in the context of HIV-1 infection, upon which other circuitry maps that describe various behavioral states and responses to treatments can be projected and compared. Our results will help to characterize cognitive impairments in HIV-1 infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy and in those using antiretrovirals as preexposure prophylaxis, and will inform future therapeutic efforts to treat HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment.",1,1R01MH134776-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,9,11,1,3

Microphysiological systems are being used by biomedical scientists for drug and toxicity testing, disease modeling, and to answer fundamental questions about cell-cell interactions in complex, but tightly controlled environments that can be parallelized for high throughput studies, often with high-resolution microscopy and other real-time readouts. In some studies, induced pluripotent stem cells (induced pluripotent stem cells) allow patient-specific models of drug testing, offering physiological relevance that cannot be matched by any animal model. A central component of nearly all microphysiological systems is the semi-permeable synthetic membrane that facilities co-culture or establishment of a tissue barrier model. This membrane serves to compartmentalize cells or microenvironments while also selectively allowing some species and even cells to transit or transmigrate, typically based simply on a pore size cut-off. While pore size is important for controlling communication between compartments or opposing sides of a barrier model, the membrane also serves as a support scaffold and culture substrate of nearly all cells involved in the system. The overall vision of this MIRA research program is to answer key questions in two interrelated domains: Improve the Understanding of Biological Mechanisms of Cell-Substrate Interactions on Porous Materials, and Advance Ultrathin Membrane Development and Engineer the Ideal Membrane for Physiologically Relevant Tissue Barrier and Co-Culture Models.

This basic principle is enshrined as a ""hallmark"" of cancer-for a cancer to exist it must evade cell death mechanisms that would shift this equation to attrition. For three decades my laboratory has worked to understand the core pathways of regulated cell death and how they are controlled at the molecular level. This program of research, the continuation of which is proposed in this application, explores the processes of regulated cell death in the forms of apoptosis and necroptosis, and seeks to understand how they are tied to other cellular physiologies, as they must be. Three general goals of this research are outlined as questions, as follows. A. What are the mechanisms of cell survival in apoptosis/necroptosis and how do these integrate with cell life? Here we use the concept of ""flatliners,"" cells that survive the activation of core apoptotic or necroptotic pathways, to probe the pathways that, when engaged, restrict these core pathways to enable transient resistance to this and subsequent stimuli. We have found that cancer cell survivors of the apoptotic pathway display increased aggressiveness in vivo and we have found signatures of these cells in minimal residual disease. Our flatliners are tested in cancer allograft and xenograft models. We will extend our studies to cells that survive necroptosis. B. What are the consequences of surviving a cellular ""near death experience (flatlining)? Cells that survive engagement of a cell death pathway (flatliners) resemble, in all aspects, cancer persister cells that survive a therapeutic treatment without selection for resistance mutations. While the definitions are distinct, we propose that flatliners can take on the properties of persisters. These include genomic stability. We have found that Gasdermin E, a caspase substrate that causes lytic cell death, limits the generation of flatliners, and thus prevents caspaseinduced DNA damage and mutation, with consquences for human cancers. C. How do diverse processes of cellular life integrate with the mechanisms of necroptosis? Necroptosis is a form of regulated necrosis that is actively inhibited by the action of a caspase, normally associated with apoptosis (but here with cell survival). We will continue our studies into regulation of necroptosis in relation to cellular physiology and develop tools to probe its activation in the context of cancer and other pathologies. Surviving necroptosis involves repairing membrane damage inflicted by the necroptosis process (a function of ESCRT) and reversing the activation of its executioner. While the understanding of the core pathways of cell death have led to one approved cancer therapeutic, our continued ""life and death"" efforts set the stage for future success in this critical arena.",2,2R35CA231620-08,RFA-CA-22-045,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,3,4,0,0

Acute changes may form a basis for progressive changes with subsequent ethanol exposures, incrementally increasing the risk of alcohol use disorder. Studies from humans to Drosophila have uncovered strong behavioral and neural links between the development of ethanol tolerance, an early form of ethanol-induced plasticity, and changes in sleep. We recently discovered in Drosophila that a small group of circadian clock neurons that regulate sleep also encode rapid ethanol tolerance, the form of tolerance that is closely associated with proximal changes in sleep. Whereas prior work in Drosophila implicated clock pacemaker genes and a potential relationship between sleep and rapid tolerance, our new data provides an anatomical locus and a focus on the specific aspects of the tolerance/sleep interaction. The long-term goal is to determine how ethanol causes changes in sleep. The expected long-term impact is a better understanding of the relation between addiction and sleep. Because rapid ethanol tolerance appears to map to some but not all sleep regulatory neurons, we hypothesize that ethanol may 'misuse' sleep circuitry. Circadian rhythms and sleep are extensively studied in Drosophila. While our understanding of rapid ethanol tolerance is less complete, it is easy to study and intriguing underlying mechanisms are beginning to emerge. The density of data on sleep mechanisms in Drosophila and mammals creates an opportunity to better understand tolerance and its relation to longer term effects of ethanol. The plan for this proposal is to determine the extent of co-encoding of rapid ethanol tolerance and sleep in Drosophila. To do this, we propose three experiments. First, we plan to map rapid ethanol tolerance in sleep circuitry. Second, we discovered that rapid ethanol tolerance is composed of a labile and a consolidated memory-like states. We plan to map these and also evolutionarily conserved tolerance genes in the sleep circuitry. Third, We plan to survey the function of the approximately 50 known sleep genes in rapid ethanol tolerance. The majority of these genes have not yet been tested for their role in tolerance. The expected outcome of the proposed research is a genetic and circuit map of rapid tolerance with respect to sleep.",1,1R21AA031324-01A1,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM,0,1,8,1

A large amount of evidence suggests a direct role of the protein in disease progression; yet, the isoformdependent structural features of apolipoprotein E remain elusive, hampering our understanding of the mechanism behind apolipoprotein E4 neurotoxicity. Indeed, current structural models of apolipoprotein E have been derived from a limited number of incomplete structures obtained from protein fragments free in solution or in complex with synthetic liposomes. Very little is known about the structure in the context of endogenously-secreted lipoproteins. Testing the ApoE Cascade Hypothesis (ApoE Cascade Hypothesis), the core focus of this U19 proposal, requires overcoming these limitations and comparing the structural differences of apolipoprotein E isoforms when bound to secreted lipoproteins and Alzheimer's disease-related pathogenic molecules such as amyloid-β (amyloid-β). Here, we propose to bypass previous experimental obstacles by using an innovative multipronged approach that combines singlemolecule fluorescence spectroscopy and cryoelectron microscopy (EM). Our approach enables accessing the conformational ensemble of apolipoprotein E in its monomeric, oligomeric, and lipid-bound forms and reveals coexistence of multiple conformations in equilibrium, which are invisible to classical methods of structural biology. In collaboration with Core B, single-molecule measurements, negative-stain, and cryo-EM will be compared and interpolated with molecular dynamics simulations to reconstruct atomistic-detailed models of the protein when bound to secreted lipoproteins and amyloid-β. In Aim 1, we will determine the isoform-specific structural ensemble of apolipoprotein E/lipoprotein particles obtained from human apolipoprotein E knockin mouse-derived astrocytes, microglia, and vascular mural cells (Project 2 and 4), as well as iPSC-derived cells (Core E), cell type-specific apolipoprotein E mouse models (Projects 3-4), and human biospecimens (Core C and D).

However, in the majority of cases, acquisition of BRAFV600E instead drives benign tumors, such as melanocytic nevi (the common mole). We seek to decipher the intracellular mechanisms that prevent full transformation, and harness this knowledge to develop candidate early diagnosis and chemoprevention strategies. We have discovered a signature of microRNAs (microRNAs) as the most differentially expressed transcripts distinguishing nevi from either normal melanocytes or melanomas. We have reported that expression of these microRNAss classifies biopsied pigmented neoplasms with high diagnostic accuracy. To determine whether knowledge of these microRNAss could aid in the prevention of melanoma: First, we conducted a comprehensive identification and functional screen of the targets of the most predictive microRNAs, MIR211-5p. Using freshly isolated and CRISPR engineered human normal, nevus and melanoma melanocytes, we identified inhibition of AURKB expression as a critical mechanism driving both BRAFV600E and MIR211-5p associated growth arrest in vitro. Therefore, in Aim 1, our objective is to assess the roll of the MIR211-5p/AURKB axis in nevus formation and transformation in vivo, and the efficacy of disrupting this axis in melanoma chemoprevention. Second, we generated a non-invasive assay for microRNAs screening of pigmented lesions prior to biopsy. In a small pilot study, we found the high accuracy of classification of melanocytic neoplasia was retained. In Aim 2, our objective is to validate the utility of using non-invasive profiling of the microRNAs signature to screen pigmented skin lesions. Three advances distinguish our proposal. The first is the reproducibility of our microRNAs classifier, currently validated on six independent datasets. Second, our model systems for this disease-engineered primary human melanocytes, nevi, and melanomas, combined with an in vivo system that recapitulates both the genetics and progression of melanoma-puts us in a unique position to control for context-specific effects when studying these critical events. Third, is our development of a non-invasive microRNAs profiling assay, a molecular profiling technique that is both non-invasive and lesion-specific. Our team, consisting of experts in both the basic biology of microRNAs and melanoma, in vivo models of melanoma, topical drug delivery, and the daily practice of melanoma surveillance, allows us to comprehensively tackle this project.

In addition, given the susceptibility to toxicants amid degenerative biological and genetic processes, exposure during old age is a critical sensitive window. Despite their significance, however, the mechanisms that mediate both processes are poorly understood. Lead (Pb) remains one of ten World Health Organization-identified toxicants of major public health concern, even though there have been decades-long efforts to manage the routes of environmental exposure. Numerous studies have demonstrated potent neurotoxic effects of lead exposure on gene expression and the epigenome, resulting in outcomes such as impaired I.Q., behavioral dysregulation, and speech and learning deficits. Our long-term goal is to determine how environmental toxicants interfere with neurobehavior during critical windows so that evidence-based strategies to prevent and treat adult-onset and transgenerational disease can be developed. The overall objective for this NIEHS R01 Award (PA-20-185) application is to determine genome function alterations and epigenetic regulation of environmentally-influenced neurobehavioral phenotypes. The central hypothesis is that environmentally relevant Pb exposure during critical sensitive windows (early development and old age) lead to genomic and epigenetic dysregulation that alters neurogenesis pathway function in the exposed and subsequent generations. The rationale for the proposed research is that investigation of the mechanisms underlying Pb-induced outcomes will advance prevention, risk-assessment, diagnostic, and treatment strategies. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine life stage-specific transcriptomic changes in neurogenesis pathways following developmental and geriatric exposure to environmentally relevant Pb levels; 2) Determine emergent changes in the epigenome related to phenotypic and genetic endpoints; 3) Determine multigenerational and transgenerational transcriptomic and epigenetic changes induced by ancestral exposure. Ultimately, these results will identify critical windows for biomarkers of effect, and inform the interplay among pathways mediating toxic endpoints.",5,5R01ES034878-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES,1,3,3,2

Specificity is possible due to spatial and temporal control of GTPase ""activation""; Guanine exchange factors (Guanine exchange factors) generate activated, GTP-bound GTPases with precise timing and localization, while specialized interactions with adhesion molecules, membrane domains and other localized structures specify GEF-GTPase interactions. GEF/GTPase circuits are complex, with localized feedbacks, multiple Guanine exchange factors controlling one GTPase, and vice versa. To dissect this spatiotemporally regulated circuitry requires imaging, and new analytical techniques that can dissect causal relationships from imaging data. Following the intentions of PAR19-158 (Bioengineering Research Grants), we propose a multidisciplinary collaboration leveraging organic chemistry, protein engineering, imaging, and computer science to fudnamentally advance signal transduction imaging and analysis. As a biological testbed we will explore the role of GEF-GTPase interactions in cell protrusion, single cell migration and collective migration. We will develop a generalizable approach to GEF biosensors, and adapt our proven GTPase biosensors to image GEF and GTPase activities in the same cell. Because GEF-GTPase interactions are heterogeneous and complex, multiplexed imaging is necessary to quantify their relative dynamics. However, perturbation of cell behavior is especially problematic when using two biosensors in the same cell. We will therefore develop new biosensor designs that greatly reduce cell perturbation. Even the most precise imaging of overlapping molecular activations has not revealed causal relationships. We will therefore adopt the framework of Granger Causality inference, which was originally devised for financial market analysis, to extract causal connections and feedback interactions from imaging data. Numerous steps will be necessary to translate the existing concepts of Granger causality to the analysis of spatially and temporally distributed molecular processes. Most importantly, we will implement a schema for Granger causality inference in multivariate time series models that will capture spatial relations, and we will combine principles of high-dimensional statistical regression with approaches from control theory to estimate information flows between variables that are coupled by strong feedbacks. We will also develop a novel clustering approach that preserves the neighborhood topology of data in a high-dimensional feature space and in the Euclidian space of the cell outline to identify signaling microdomains. Finally, to test and confirm our hypotheses, we will use new photo-activatable and photo-inhibitable analogs of Guanine exchange factors together with GTPase biosensors to control one protein while observing another. This research plan will produce biosensors with reduced perturbation, biosensor/optogenetic multiplexing capabilities, and image analysis/modeling approaches necessary to shed light on the network topology of nonlinear, spatiotemporally controlled signaling pathways.

The latent HIV reservoir is a major barrier to curing HIV, but multiple technical challenges limit its investigation. We developed an ultra-high throughput droplet microfluidic workflow called PCR activated cell sorting (PCR activated cell sorting) that detects, sorts and sequences single cells containing a single copy of intracellular HIV DNA. In preliminary studies we demonstrated the ability of PCR activated cell sorting to 1) process millions of cells at ultra-high throughput, 2) detect HIV infected cells 3) single cell sort and sequence this rare population of latently infected CD4 T cells. Based on these findings, we believe that PCR activated cell sorting provides a unique opportunity to overcome existing technical challenges and define, for the first time, the genomic mechanisms that control the HIV latent reservoir. We hypothesize that latently infected cells have unique properties that allow them to harbor replication competent HIV genomes without producing virus. Thus, we propose to combine PCR activated cell sorting with methods for single cell RNA-seq, genome and integration site analysis, ATAC-seq and proteomics to define the genomic mechanisms that control the HIV latent reservoir in single infected cells from people with ART suppression of the virus. Our Specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1: Define the transcriptome of single cells harboring latent virus. We propose to sequence the transcriptomes of single HIV positive CD4 T cells isolated from the blood of individuals on ART, while determining in parallel the HIV provirus sequence and insertion site. These studies will define the transcriptional program of latently infected cells harboring full-length replication competent virus. Specific Aim 2: Establish the chromatin landscape of single cells harboring latent virus. We propose to analyze the chromatin profile of single HIV positive CD4 T cells in order to define the relationship between host DNA chromatin status and HIV latency. These studies will determine the role of chromatin status in the control of HIV latency and identify regulators of the transcriptional program of latently infected CD4 T cells. Specific Aim 3: Identify surface markers of latently infected CD4 T cells. We propose to isolate HIV latently infected CD4 T cells using PCR activated cell sorting and analyze their surface proteome using barcoded antibody sequencing to identify surface marker combinations that best define the HIV latent reservoir. Upon completion, these studies will define novel surface marker combinations to identify latently infected CD4 T cells. IN SUMMARY, these studies use a multi-omics approach based on our combined expertise in the genomic regulation of immune cells, HIV biology, and microfluidics to define the mechanisms that control HIV latency. Hence, these studies will guide the development of novel therapeutic interventions, while providing novel tools for the monitoring of the latent HIV reservoir in infected individuals undergoing ART.",5,5R01AI149699-05,RFA-AI-18-053,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

Aggressive pituitary tumors are devastating, lifelimiting malignancies with two patterns of growth:  they can remain confined to the skull base and grow relentlessly, resulting in progressive neurologic dysfunction or  they can metastasize. These tumors are poorly studied and under-recognized in part because there are no validated biomarkers that predict future aggressive behavior. We hypothesize that recurrent patterns of copy number variation, including a molecular hypodiploidy phenotype, characterized by an early, clonal loss of one copy of chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 21, and 22, predict future progression following treatment with radiotherapy. Additionally, we hypothesize that aggressive pituitary adenomas and carcinomas harbor recurrent epigenetic and genetic alterations at a gene and pathway level that define a more aggressive molecular subtype. This foundational work is needed so that clinicians can prospectively identify tumors with a higher malignant potential. The identification of a biomarker of aggressive disease is critical for improving patient outcomes by preventing both overand undertreatment, and for clinical trial development.",5,5R21CA280469-02,PAR-20-292,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Chemotherapy is the current standard of care for Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase+ Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, but fails in approximately 30% of patients. Most Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase+ Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma that fail chemotherapy respond well to the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tyrosine kinase inhibitors), such as crizotinib, with higher responses in children than in adults and FDA agency recently granted the breakthrough therapy designation for crizotinib for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase+ Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma. Based on these exciting results, it is not impossible to think that in the future Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors will become the first-line therapy for Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma, thus overcoming the long-term toxicity of chemotherapy. A similar switch has happened in the case of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase+ nonsmall cell lung cancer (nonsmall cell lung cancer) that is currently treated in first-line with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Despite most Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase+ Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma patients refractory to chemotherapy achieve complete remission when treated with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors, still a fraction of patients quickly develop resistance. In addition, responder patients are not completely cured as discontinuation of crizotinib is associated with rapid lymphoma relapse even after many years of complete remission with undetectable disease. Therefore, Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma can develop molecular mechanisms that protect lymphoma cells from the activity of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors. To achieve the ambitious goal of treating Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase+ Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma with targeted therapy and replace chemotherapy as much as possible, there is need to completely understand these mechanisms that lead to Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase TKI resistance in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma. By genetic screenings, extensive sequencing and mouse models, we identified three main mechanisms leading to Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase TKI resistance and possibly sustaining the long-term persistence of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma cells: - we identified a phosphatase-mediated mechanism when we discovered that PTPN1 and PTPN2 are phosphatases of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase and together with the SHP2 phosphatase regulate the sensitivity of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma cells to Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors; - we discovered that activation of PI3Kγ signaling supports survival of persister cells during Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase inhibition; - we elucidated the key role of the Rho family GTPases to mediate Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase signaling in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma. For this project, we hypothesize that targeting these three main pathways with specific combined therapies could cope with resistance and lead to the eradication of persister cells for a complete cure of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase+ Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma. In this project, we will validate this concept with in vitro and in vivo models that will be used to test different therapeutic strategies. Thus, Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase+ Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma could become the first T cell lymphoma to be completely cured without chemotherapy, with obvious long-term benefits for children and adults affected by this disease. In addition, our results could pave the way to broaden these therapeutic concepts to other incurable T cell lymphoma.",5,5R01CA196703-09,PA-19-056,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,16,0,4,4

For example, cancers with deletion/mutation of the driver tumor suppressor gene PTEN and consequently elevated AKT and mTOR signaling are considered rational candidates for PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor therapy. Accordingly, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are approved or in clinical trials for various cancers with PTEN/PI3K alterations. However, in glioblastoma (glioblastoma) where PTEN loss of function occurs in over 60% of patients, PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors have been largely ineffective. It is often overlooked that when tumor suppressor genes undergo deletion, nearby genes also undergo inadvertent co-deletion. These bystander genes are not necessarily tumor suppressor genes. In fact, many of them are important for cell growth and survival. In some cases, such bystander deletion events create a unique drug sensitivity specifically in cancer cells. For example, deletion of one of the two alleles of POLR2 (a subunit of RNA polymerase II codeleted as a bystander to P53 deletion) reduces the amount of POLR2 protein and creates high sensitivity of these cells to low dose POLR2 inhibitors. There are several other such bystander deletion events in cancer that causes vulnerability specifically to cancer cells (e.g., PSMC2 deletion due to chromosome 7q22 loss, Enolase 1 deletion due to loss of 1p36 tumor suppressor locus, MAGOHB deletion as part of chromosome 1p loss, and MTAP co-deletion with the tumor suppressor CDKN2A). Searching the TCGA database we have identified that a crucial lipogenic gene is hemizygously deleted as bystander to the tumor suppressor PTEN (on chromosome 10) in glioblastoma, melanoma and prostate cancer. The fatty acid synthesized by the lipogenic enzyme is also present in our diet. Therefore, when we reduced this fatty acid from diet, inhibition of residual activity of the lipogenic gene with specific inhibitors killed glioblastoma and melanoma cells. This subset (subset 1) ultimately acquired drug resistance through a stress response pathway, and were eliminated by a specific pre-clinical grade inhibitor of the stress pathway. During our analysis, we also surprisingly discovered that this lipogenic gene in completely suppressed in a second glioblastoma subset (subset 2) due to a combination of deletion and methylation. Subset 2 lost a gene that is important for growth and proliferation, and yet thrived, through yet unknown alternative mechanisms. Due to loss of the target lipogenic gene, subset 2 lines were completely resistant to the lipogenic enzyme inhibitor. Investigating the mechanism of survival of subset 2 glioblastoma is outside the scope of this application. In this proposal we will use a repertoire of primary glioblastoma lines and test if deletion and methylation status of the lipogenic gene can be used as biomarkers for inhibitor therapy in combination with a custom medicinal diet. Secondly, we will perform molecular, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and preclinical studies to address the mechanism of acquired resistance of subset 1 glioblastoma. These tests will be performed in a well-established preclinical mouse model of intracranial glioma.",5,5R01NS114074-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,4,0,4,4

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving this process are still far from clear. This proposal stems from a series of recently published and unpublished observations in my laboratory that identify the two atypical PKCs (aPKC; PKC and PKC/) as novel tumor suppressors acting in concert to prevent this aggressive form of CRC. Thus, the simultaneous loss of both aPKCs in the intestinal epithelium (in a new DKOIEC mouse line) results in highly mesenchymal adenocarcinomas with a reactive and strongly immunosuppressed stroma. Both aPKCs are significantly downregulated in mesenchymal/stromal/ immunosuppressive CRC human patients who have the most unfavorable prognosis. Our unpublished preliminary data demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cells (intestinal epithelial cells) deficient in PKC/ (or both aPKCs) upregulate the stem cell receptor CD44, concomitant with the downregulation of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells, suggesting the appearance of a new type of tumor initiating cells (tumor initiating cells). Inhibition of CD44+ in tumor organoids demonstrate its requirement for growth and supports its physiopathological relevance. Consistently, inhibition of one of the key CD44 stromal ligands (hyaluronan) in vivo abrogates the mesenchymal phenotype of DKOIEC tumors inhibiting the immunosuppressive response and restoring immunosurveillance. We hypothesize that the upregulation of a new type of CD44+/Lgr5tumor initiating cells by the loss of PKC/ is central in the development of the aggressive type of CRC. The upregulation of the MAP kinase cascades, together with the identification, in a series of unbiassed approaches, of the transcription factor KLF4 as a potential critical intermediary between PKC/ and CD44 expression, led us to hypothesize that the activation of ERK/JNK by PKC/ deficiency triggers AP1 and, concurrently, induces the degradation of KLF4; both actions cooperate to drive CD44 expression and the mesenchymal phenotype of very aggressive CRC. Therefore, in this proposal, we will determine the role of CD44 in the aggressive/mesenchymal type of CRC (Aim 1), as well as the molecular mechanisms whereby PKC/ regulates CD44 expression and function in this process (Aim 2). The successful completion of the proposed studies will create a new paradigm of significance and impact that will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms driving the poor prognosis mesenchymal type of CRC, which will be key for the design of new therapeutic targets for this type of aggressive neoplasia.",5,5R01CA250025-04,PA-19-056,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Understandably, this leads to a loss of movement control: the limbs become weak, and movements are slower and less well-coordinated. In addition to loss of function, patients also gain unwanted muscle contractions called synergies. For example, whenever the arm is lifted (shoulder abduction), the elbow flexes. These co-contractions intrude into normal movements. Synergies, not just weakness or lack of control, are a major contributor to disability in stroke survivors. Many previous studies have investigated stroke recovery in animals (typically monkeys because of the close similarities of their motor system to humans), but these have focused on recovery of lost function, not on synergies. One reason is that in most previous work monkeys did not express overt synergies; until now we have therefore lacked a model of one of the major causes of post-stroke disability. This critical gap in our understanding has largely gone unnoticed. We need to know how to induce synergies in monkeys, which neural circuits are responsible for them, how they are controlled in health, and how this control becomes disordered after stroke. This project seeks to address this gap, paving the way for a rational approach to new therapy for synergies. In the first experiment, monkeys will be trained on a reaching task, and then implanted with electrodes to measure muscle activity. High speed video recordings will extract movement kinematics. An instrumented linear motor will measure tendon-tap reflexes. After baseline recordings, we will induce a focal cortical ischemic lesion, and gather further data over the subsequent months. We will measure the development of inappropriate contractions of elbow flexors with shoulder abductors during outward reaches. We will analyze reaching trajectories to quantify quality of movement (equivalent to a dexterity measure in the hand, but for reach). Tendon tap reflexes will assess spasticity. Lesions of five different cortical regions will be compared. The lesion which produces the most severe synergy will then be combined with damage to the magnocellular red nucleus, which we hypothesize will further accentuate synergy expression. This experiment will elucidate the detailed functional anatomy of the post-stroke syndrome, and also yield an optimized monkey model of pathological synergies. In the second experiment, monkeys will be trained to move an on-screen cursor controlled by shoulder abduction-elbow flexion torques into targets, allowing parametric examination of independent versus coactivation. Initially neural circuits will be characterized in healthy monkeys. After necessary surgical implants, neural activity will be recorded from different parts of the motor cortex, the reticular formation, and the spinal cord. We hypothesize that spinal circuits will show neural activity consistent with co-activation of shoulder and elbow muscles to generate synergies; activity in supraspinal areas will be consistent with either driving this spinal circuit, or suppressing it to allow independent muscle activation. Recordings will then be repeated in monkeys subjected to the lesion which generates optimal synergies, to reveal the nature of pathological changes.",5,5R01NS119319-04,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

Yet, prospective, longitudinal, studies across the life span are critical to identify biomarkers of ELA risk embedded earlier in life, during middle age to develop early intervention strategies. Animal models with short life spans (invertebrates, rodents) have significant limitations to inform about human aging and the therapeutics developed from those models have failed in clinical trials. Longitudinal nonhuman primate (nonhuman primate) studies could provide significant information on early biological and neural markers of ELA-related cognitive decline due to their long life span and gradual aging-related cognitive impairments and brain pathology similar to those in humans emerging in middle age. This proposal builds on our data linking ELA in macaques with early markers of accelerated cellular aging (accelerated DNA methylation age, shortened telomere length), inflammation, and neurocognitive alterations detectable from infancy to young adulthood. The goal is to use a prospective, longitudinal design in nonhuman primates to identify early biomarkers/pathways and underlying mechanisms of ELA-related accelerated neural aging trajectories and cognitive decline from young adulthood to middle age. This unique population of adult female macaques with ELA (social subordination stress) are currently living in social groups at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center and were longitudinally characterized from birth through puberty as part of NIH-funded studies. These animals (High-ELA: subordinates; low-ELA: dominant) will be studied longitudinally between 7(early adulthood) and 11 (middle age) years of age. Aim 1 will examine trajectories of ELA-accelerated neural aging in brain regions that control cognitive and stress/emotional functions studied in Aim 2 (prefrontal cortex -PFC-, hippocampus -HIPP-, amygdala); it will use (a) MRI, DTI and resting state fMRI to examine myelin loss, cortical thinning and loss of long-range connectivity; (b) measures of neuropathology with MR spectroscopy (reductions in N-Acetylaspartate) and markers preceding dementia in humans (reduced amyloid β(Aβ42)/tau ratio in CSF); and (c) markers of neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity (CSF levels of kynurenine pathway metabolites). Aim 2 will test whether ELA accelerates agerelated deficits in stress/emotional regulation mediated by PFC-amygdala circuits (HPA axis, Human Intruder and dot-probe tasks), and cognition: attention (continuous performance task), executive function and cognitive flexibility mediated by PFC circuits (Intradimensional/Extradimensional discrimination), and spatial relational memory mediated by HIPP-PFC circuits (spatial memory span). Aim 3 will examine associations between longitudinal trajectories of neural measures (Aim 1) and cognitive outcomes (Aim 2); we will use innovative longitudinal statistical approaches developing individualized trajectory biomarkers of risk and resilience that move beyond association to establishing statistical causation.

Here, we aim to construct tractography atlases at unprecedented details as structural connectome for mouse, rat, and rhesus macaque and developed associated toolboxes for novel tractography analytics.

Of necessity the former evolved the flexibility to bind and oxidize a broad range of small molecule chemical scaffolds, while the latter appear to be less flexible and have more substrate specificity. What we know about the structures of all of these membrane proteins has been determined solely by X-ray crystallography. This approach provides detailed information about atomic-level protein/ligand interactions, but has not been applied across the human spectrum of P450 enzymes and does not capture the range of conformations these enzymes are capable of adopting or their interactions with other proteins. Thus application of a cross-section of structural techniques is essential to provide the information needed to understand which P450 enzymes bind which small molecules, how they are bound, and what the products will be. This information is critical for understanding drug/toxin metabolism to forms that may be either active or inactive, adverse interactions of two drugs at the same P450 active site, and endogenous pathways related to diverse diseases. The applicant's long-term research goal is to promote understanding of the structure/function principles that control substrate and inhibitor interactions with P450 enzymes, in order that this information can be exploited to more effectively prevent and treat human disease. The objective of this proposal is to generate structures of new human cytochrome P450 enzymes with the critical components of the catalytic system: their ligands·, redox partner proteins, and eventually the membrane. A number of human cytochrome P450 enzymes do not have structures available and none have structures with their catalytic partner proteins. These are gaps we propose to bridge using the following approaches, building on our previous structural expertise with more than 20 human cytochrome P450 enzymes and a collaboration with cryo-electron microscopist Dr. Melanie Ohi. Specific aim 1: Determine structures of human P450 enzymes. A structure exists for only about half of the 57 human cytochrome P450 enzymes. Many of those without structures are involved in key homeostatic pathways involving bile acids, fatty acids, eicosanoids, and vitamins, impeding our understanding of a number of corresponding diseases. We take advantage of this R37 extension opportunity to propose a small-scale structural genomics project to ""close the gap"" by determining structures of as many of these P450 enzymes as possible. As we have done successfully for many other human P450 enzymes, we will 1) engineer synthetic genes in ways that usually produce P450 holoproteins, 2) undertake expression and purification trials, and 3) subject those yielding enough active P450 protein to crystallization for X-ray structure determination. We will initially focus on those responsible for bile acid and fatty acid synthesis as we have additional expertise and tools to support success in these areas. As specific ligands can be critical for stability and crystallization, we will use a range of nonspecific luminescent P450 substrates to screen ligands that bind each P450 tightly and are likely to facilitate crystallization, as has been successful for CYP1A 1. In cases where protein is generated but crystallization does not occur (CYP2S1, CYP2W1, CYP3A7, CYP2F currently in hand), we will initiate structures using cryoEM. Preliminary studies in collaboration with Dr. Melanie Ohi have very quickly yielded a small data set for CYP3A4 with 2D resolution good enough to visualize alpha helices. Even if crystallization is successful with a particular P450 enzyme, this latter approach is independently valuable as it is likely to reveal P450 ""open"" conformations that must exist but are usually not obtained in crystals. Specific aim 2: Determine structural effects of cytochrome bs and reductase binding to human P450 enzymes. There are no structures of b5 or reductase binding to any human P450 enzymes. Over the last grant period we used NMR to identify the two b5. surfaces that differentially bind individual cytochrome P450 enzymes. The next step proposed is to use NMR to identify the opposing surfaces on individual P450 enzymes and the effects that b5 binding has on the conformation of these P450 enzymes and their interactions with ligands. We know from our previous studies that when b5. binds CYP17 A1 that major conformational changes occur on the opposite face of the P450, which is normally involved in membrane binding and ligand entry/exit from the active site. It is unclear if this is generally true. Advanced labeling techniques and substrate-directed NMR will be used to answer these questions. Finally, we will employ our P450/redox partner fusion constructs to elucidate the feasibility of determining structures of selected complexes using cryoEM.

These obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens cause mild-to-life-threatening vascular diseases in humans and have a limited set of diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. To promote widespread disease, Spotted Fever Group Rickettsia species have evolved dynamic strategies to invade host cells, escape into the cytosol, and spread from cell to cell. We hypothesize that Spotted Fever Group Rickettsia coordinate their complex life cycle by delivering an arsenal of secreted bacterial proteins (i.e., effectors) that reprogram host cell processes. Unfortunately, the identity and host targets of these secreted effectors have remained largely unknown. Furthermore, direct analysis of the secretion systems and putative effectors have been hampered due to challenges in growing and genetically manipulating these pathogens in the lab. To overcome this barrier, we recently adapted forward genetics and plasmid-based complementation to the model Spotted Fever Group member Rickettsia parkeri, allowing for powerful functional-genetic studies of Spotted Fever Group Rickettsia pathogenesis. Using these tools, we discovered that the secreted effector Sca4 promotes a late stage of cell-to-cell spread by manipulating host cell-cell adhesion. Additionally, transposon mutagenesis of a secreted effector of unknown function (RARP-1) and a component of the anomalous Rickettsia Type 4 secretion system (VirB6e) impairs distinct stages of R. parkeri infection. This proposal will leverage these key advances to examine how a secretion system and secreted effectors promote different steps of the R. parkeri infectious life cycle. Here, we combine our functional-genetic strategies and expertise in host cell biology, with modern biochemical techniques to reveal critical, mechanistic insights into Spotted Fever Group Rickettsia pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will examine the function and secretome of the T4SS component VirB6e. In Aim 2, we will determine how the secreted effector RARP-1 promotes R. parkeri infection. In Aim 3, we will elucidate how Sca4 specifically targets host cell-cell adhesion complexes during R. parkeri cell-to-cell spread. Collectively, the proposed research will dramatically improve our fundamental understanding of Rickettsia biology and Rickettsia-host interactions and reveal therapeutic targets to prevent or treat tickborne diseases.",5,5R01AI155489-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

Control of inflammation is a key to the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Hepatic lymphatics are highly involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response by discharging extravasated fluids, inflammatory mediators, antigens, and antigen-presenting cells to lymph nodes outside the liver. However, how the hepatic lymphatic system is involved in the development of alcohol-associated liver disease remains largely unknown. The goal of this exploratory study is to advance our understanding of hepatic lymphatics in the progression of alcoholic hepatitis and explore whether increasing lymphatic vessels (lymphatic vessels) and lymphatic drainage can be a novel therapeutic strategy for alcoholic hepatitis. Given that lymphatics generally help to reduce tissue inflammation, we hypothesize that chronic alcohol consumption may impair hepatic lymphatic endothelial cell (endothelial cell) function and lymphatic drainage, facilitating the progression to alcoholic hepatitis. Contrarily, enhancing lymphangiogenesis (new LV formation) via overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, the most potent lymphangiogenic factor, may ameliorate alcoholic hepatitis. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following two Aims: Aim 1. Determine the role of the hepatic lymphatic system in alcoholic hepatitis. Aim 2. Explore the potential of the VEGF-C mRNA LNP (lipid nanoparticle) technology for the treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis. This study will explore an important, but poorly understood subject, liver lymphatics in alcohol-associated liver disease, addressing the effect of alcohol on hepatic lymphatic functions and its implications in the development of alcoholic hepatitis. Results from the two Aims above will provide the foundation for many future studies to advance our understanding of the lymphatic system in liver disease in general and alcoholic hepatitis in particular, including a study addressing the molecular mechanism of lymphatic impairment by alcohol as well as a study aiming at clinical use of VEGF-C mRNA-LNP for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis.",5,5R21AA031400-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM,12,2,0,0

For example, over the last quarter-century, the Dartmouth Atlas Project has focused on variation in Medicare feefor-service health care use for diagnostically defined cohorts of patients, often conditioning on future outcomes (e.g., death) to account for variation in health status. Numerous other claims studies have also used Medicare claims data to estimate comparative effectiveness of different treatments and procedures. Almost all of these types of research studies have used a nationwide measure of health care markets created at Dartmouth known as ""hospital referral regions (hospital referral regions)."" These regional markets, and the methodology underlying their delineation, have remained largely unchanged for nearly 30 years. In addition, because Medicare primarily covers people aged 65 and over, these regional measures-even at the time-are not representative of the whole population, leading to questions regarding the external validity of the published results especially given the tendency to equate such findings with the whole population. Motivated by the recent surge of interest in health and health care inequities, a growing concern in algorithmic bias, availability of newer and more extensive data on younger populations, and advances in network and geospatial analysis, this project proposes to revisit the methodology, definitions, and practical applications of regional and network measures of health care use and outcomes. These new approaches will avoid the potential biases of prior geographic measures by better capturing care patterns of underserved populations, and will facilitate geographic variations and comparative-effectiveness research that overcomes bias and possesses greater statistical power to detect effects of interest. Secondly, this project will develop new measures that quantify heterogeneity of geographic and other variations in use and spending across population strata, including disparity indices. Thirdly, this project will evaluate the bias of Medicare estimates and develop procedures to generalize results to other populations. Results of all analyses, including the algorithms for HRR delineation, will be used to modernize statistical and geographic approaches to characterizing health care access and health outcomes. These will be widely disseminated to research and stakeholder communities, thus empowering public health professionals and researchers to define analysis and administrative units pertaining to their specific health care systems and needs. This project will have a major impact on the research communities engaged in the evaluation of geographic variation in health care delivery and health outcomes.",1,1R01LM014233-01A1,PAR-23-034,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,1,3,3,2

Despite much work, it is still unclear how early stop codons are recognized and how they bring about mRNA decay. The long-term goal of the work is to illuminate how cells recognize and repress mRNAs with early stop codons in animals. Work over the last several decades has highlighted many of the factors involved as well as some of their biochemical capabilities, but the steps and structure/function of the molecules involved remains unclear. In this proposal, the PI and his lab will dissect the pathway of protein synthesis and degradation of early stop codon-containing mRNAs in vivo. The specific aims of the proposed work are to: [Aim 1]: characterize the mRNA cleavage reaction, its products, and its dependencies on protein factors. Results from this aim will provide information about the biochemistry of the RNA decay reaction underlying Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay. [Aim 2]: study the role the factor UPF1 has in licensing mRNAs for decay. Results from this aim will illuminate the factors underlying the timing, recruitment, and commitment of mRNAs to decay.

The current approach to affixing a cardiac implantable electronic device lead to the heart of a young patient is to open the chest and sew the lead directly to the epicardium (""epicardial leads""), whereas the approach in older adolescents and adults is passing it through veins and affixing to the endocardium (""endocardial leads""). Once epicardial leads are implanted, however, the patient is no longer eligible for routine magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging) due to the increased risk of radiofrequency (RF)-induced heating of myocardial tissue. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that there is no straightforward method to extract leads, so children who receive such leads are excluded from the benefits of magnetic resonance imaging even if a subsequent FDA-approved endocardial cardiac implantable electronic device system replaces an epicardial system when they are older. Such patients are often referred for alternative imaging modalities with ionizing radiation, which may result in suboptimal care and a significant radiation risk for children. Our strong, preliminary data show that congenital heart defects patients with a cardiac implantable electronic device have four-fold higher cumulative effective doses of radiation from computed tomography and X-ray than matched pediatric congenital heart defects patients with no cardiac implantable electronic device, thereby highlighting an urgent need to increase access to magnetic resonance imaging for pediatric cardiac implantable electronic device patients. The 2017 HRS consensus statement is blunt in emphasizing the need for more research: ""Given the paucity of data related to the safety of magnetic resonance imaging [with epicardial leads], recommendations cannot be made [and] many questions remain unanswered."" Even if magnetic resonance imaging safety issues are resolved through engineering, the diagnostic yield of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging remains low due to severe image artifact caused by the Implantable Pulse Generator (Implantable Pulse Generator). Existing ""wideband"" pulse sequences developed for adults are unsuitable for pediatric cardiac implantable electronic device patients due to two main reasons: (a) the proximity of Implantable Pulse Generator to the heart is closer in pediatric patients than adults, necessitating a wider bandwidth RF pulse design; (b) pediatric patients have smaller hearts and faster heart rates than adults, necessitating higher data acquisition acceleration. In direct response to this unmet clinical need, this study seeks to develop innovative technologies to achieve the following three objectives:  determine imaging conditions under which magnetic resonance imaging can be performed safely in children, regardless of cardiac implantable electronic device types and abandoned leads;  develop, implement, and validate physics-based epicardial lead implantation strategies that minimize the variation and magnitude of RF heating in pediatric patients with a cardiac implantable electronic device;  develop and validate age-specific, free-breathing, wideband cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging pulse sequences that produce diagnostically acceptable image quality in pediatric cardiac implantable electronic device patients. If successful, our work will extend magnetic resonance imaging access to a growing number of pediatric patients with a cardiac implantable electronic device and deliver age-specific free-breathing wideband pulse sequences that produce diagnostically acceptable image quality.",1,1R01HL168859-01A1,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",14,8,7,1

When probands carrying pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (pathogenic variants) are asked to share medically actionable genetic results with their at-risk relatives, less than 30% of at-risk relatives complete predictive ""cascade"" testing, putting lives at risk. Provider -facilitated outreach to at-risk relatives leads to improved cascade testing uptake. Yet, rigorous experimental study designs have not been used to demonstrate comparative effectiveness of this approach for sustainably expanding at-risk relatives access to cancer genetic counseling and testing, or to investigate whether digital technology may enhance provider-facilitated outreach. Patients with a variant of uncertain significance (variant of uncertain significance) may also benefit from enhanced genetic counseling engagement; current standard of care leaves serious risks for misinterpretation by patients and non-genetics providers, and consequent medical mismanagement. Patients may experience negative responses to variant of uncertain significance, particularly when encountering discordant interpretations or recommendations between providers and confusion about how they will receive variant updates. In addition, best practices for follow-up and reassessment of a variant of uncertain significance would benefit from technology to support continuity of patient care with local primary care providers (primary care providers). The proposed study addresses these needs by assessing the impact of a new genetic counseling model that leverages the increasing digitization of healthcare on psychosocial, behavioral, and implementation outcomes for probands with pathogenic variants and their at-risk relatives, and for patients with a variant of uncertain significance result. We will first enhance an existing digital tool to include linguistically tailored and end-user vetted features that increase patient access, education, and sustained engagement. We will incorporate feedback on this enhanced Digital Genetics Platform (enhanced Digital Genetics Platform) from relevant end-user cognitive interviews (n=60) and a focus group (n≈10). Next, we will conduct two RCTs involving either probands with a pathogenic variants (n=350) and their at-risk relatives (n≈3150), or patients with a variant of uncertain significance (n=280). Probands and their at-risk relatives will be randomized to the standard of care arm, wherein probands outreach to at-risk relatives to encourage testing, or the intervention arm, wherein the genetic counseling team is given permission to outreach to at-risk relatives with support from the enhanced Digital Genetics Platform to expand service access across the U.S. Patients with a variant of uncertain significance will be randomized to obtain follow-up care through the standard of care arm, wherein they are recommended to re-contact the genetic counseling care team in 1-2 years, or the intervention arm, wherein they access the enhanced Digital Genetics Platform to remain engaged with the genetic counseling care team, and receive education and reminders for update appointments. We will also directly assess primary care providers' uptake of digital variant of uncertain significance education. Participants will complete surveys to assess uptake, psychosocial and behavioral outcomes, and intervention implementation readiness and cost.

Unknown etiology is observed across a wide array of clinical phenotypes in liver disease, such as acute liver failure (acute liver failure), hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. These are collectively referred to as cryptogenic liver disease (cryptogenic liver disease). It has long been hypothesized there exist additional human viruses that cause cryptogenic liver disease. In our recent serum virome study, we identified a 387-nt DNA fragment (GenBank MW468091), named Seq260, from 1 of 9 cryptogenic liver disease patients. In a series of experiments of gene-walking, enzymatic digestion, and rolling circle amplification and analyses, we have demonstrated that Seq260 is a linear single-stranded DNA. We screened Seq260 in 409 subjects, including healthy blood donors (n=200), hepatitis C virus infection (n=100), Acute liver failure (acute liver failure) patients without known etiology (n=14 indeterminate etiology (n=50), and liver transplantation (liver transplantation) patients without known etiology (n=14 (n=45) and without known etiology (n=14out known etiology (n=14). Seq260 was detected in 5 cryptogenic liver disease patients (1 acute liver failure and 4 liver transplantation) and 1 liver transplantation patient without known etiology (n=14 nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-associated cirrhosis. One patient had Seq260 quantifiable in liver, showing a titer in the liver 7.74 times higher than that in serum (2.4x106 copies/g vs. 3.1x105 copies/mL). Machine learning analysis reached a high score (likelihood) of Seq260 being a eukaryotic viral sequence. Aggregately, these data lead to our hypothesis that Seq260 represents an unrecognized human virus without known etiology (n=14 liver tropism. To determine if Seq260 represents a novel hepatitis virus, we bring about a research plan in the current proposal that consists of three major experiments. First, we will screen Seq260 in cryptogenic liver disease patients as well as the controls. We have been granted access to patient specimens from two NIHsponsored clinical trials, acute liver failure study group (acute liver failureSG), and the adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation cohort study (A2ALL). Unknown etiology accounted for 5.5% and 29.5% respectively in the acute liver failureSG and A2ALL. Seq260 copy numbers will be quantitated in both serum and liver in Seq260-positive patients without known etiology (n=14 liver tissue available. Second, we will determine the full genome of the putative virus containing Seq260. Finally, we will evaluate antibody responses in virus-positive patients and the controls. A peptide-based serological test will be developed for the putative virus. Peptides will be individually assessed for their specificity and sensitivity in two virus-positive patients without known etiology (n=14 large volumes of serum available. Selected peptides will then be combined to ELISA tests for the measurement of antibody (IgG and IgM) responses in virus-positive and virus-negative patients.

The co-occurrence of alcohol use disorder/posttraumatic stress disorder is characterized by more severe symptomatology, greater functional impairment, increased suicide risk, and poorer treatment outcomes as compared to either disorder alone. Trauma-focused, cognitive-behavioral interventions delivered alongside interventions for substance use disorders are most effective in reducing posttraumatic stress disorder severity and substance use. Cognitive Processing Therapy (Cognitive Processing Therapy) for posttraumatic stress disorder and Relapse Prevention (Relapse Prevention) for alcohol use disorder are two of the most widely used and efficacious behavioral treatments for these conditions. The investigators successfully developed and pilot tested a therapy manual that combines Cognitive Processing Therapy with Relapse Prevention. The preliminary data demonstrate safety, feasibility, high rates of retention (80.0%) and patient satisfaction. Moreover, our data from a recent national survey of frontline mental health providers (N = 76) indicate that Cognitive Processing Therapy is the most commonly used trauma-focused treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder and providers are highly interested in an integrative Cognitive Processing Therapy-Relapse Prevention intervention, conferring strong potential for uptake in real-world practice settings. In fact, due to the lack of an available, empirically developed, manualized Cognitive Processing Therapy-Relapse Prevention treatment, 84.0% of frontline providers report attempting on their own to create such a treatment to use with their patients. This may result in highly variable and suboptimal implementation and outcomes. In response to provider input and positive preliminary data, the proposed study directly addresses this critical need by evaluating a new integrative Cognitive Processing TherapyRelapse Prevention treatment for individuals with co-occurring alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. At present, only one trauma-focused, integrative intervention is available for alcohol use disorder/posttraumatic stress disorder and it uses Prolonged Exposure (Prolonged Exposure) to reduce posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. In comparison to Prolonged Exposure, Cognitive Processing Therapy is more widely used, often preferred by clinicians, equally as effective in reducing posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and associated with lower dropout rates. Thus, the new Cognitive Processing Therapy-Relapse Prevention intervention could have wider reach and greater acceptability than exposure-based treatments. Treatment choice is related to improved treatment outcomes, and therefore, there is an immediate need to add to the portfolio of evidence-based, trauma-focused, integrative treatments for alcohol use disorder/posttraumatic stress disorder. The primary objective of this Stage II study is to examine the efficacy of Cognitive Processing Therapy-Relapse Prevention, as compared to Relapse Prevention alone, in reducing  alcohol use frequency and quantity and  posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity among individuals with current alcohol use disorder/posttraumatic stress disorder. To accomplish this, we will employ a manualized intervention, randomized study design, and standardized repeated dependent measures of clinical outcomes at multiple time points. Putative mechanisms of behavior change will be evaluated via daily monitoring. The proposed study aligns closely with the mission of NIAAA in that it aims to produce maximally efficacious behavioral interventions for alcohol use disorder and comorbid psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder. The findings from this study will provide new information to advance the science of alcohol use disorder/posttraumatic stress disorder comorbidity and innovate clinical practice.",5,5R01AA030157-03,PAR-19-212,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM,6,5,8,2

Readmissions not only are disruptive but also cause enormous economic burden for patients and families, and are a key driver of rising healthcare costs. Reducing and predicting unplanned readmission are therefore major unmet needs of psychiatric care. Developing machine learning (ML)-based natural language processing (natural language processing) prediction tools using electronic health records (electronic health records) is a key priority as such tools could not only be used to help target the delivery of resource-intensive interventions to those patients at greatest risk, but also reduce psychiatric healthcare costs. A key aspect in building effective risk predictive models is the modeling of temporal structure in the narratives. Information about the historical and present health states and timing of events (e.g., substance use start/stop timing, recent fluctuations in suicidality or symptoms), may play a key role in predicting readmission risk. Natural language annotation (i.e., tagging text such as events, symptoms, and anchoring them on a timeline) is a key step for training ML classifiers. No psychiatry-specific resources or guidelines exist for the modeling of temporality in clinical text, and as a result no robust scalable and explainable ML predictive models incorporating temporal information have been developed. We propose to deliver a psychiatric specific temporal relation annotation scheme, build open-source tools for extracting temporal information, and develop readmission prediction models for psychiatric patients. Aim 1 is a data resource creation aim in which we create a large repository of psychiatric text for building our readmission classifier, de-identify a subset of that data to allow for sharing with the research community, and create a layer of temporal annotations for that subset. In Aim 2, we extract temporal information from the data in the repository to create temporal graphs, and apply graph neural networks to these graphs to extract features for predicting 30-day readmission risk. In Aim 3 we build and evaluate multiple versions of 30-day readmission risk classifiers, and feedback performance to Aim 2 to improve temporal modeling. We develop unsupervised clustering on top of our classifiers to discover patient sub-groups. We include practical evaluations including a comparison to human experts and an evaluation of model performance on simulated future data. The study brings together a team experienced in psychiatric phenotyping and application of electronic health records, and a team active in developing cuttingedge methods in ML for natural language data.

However, nearly 60% of arteriovenous fistulas fail to mature into a clinically useful conduit due to insufficient outward remodeling and flow capacity, occlusive neointimal hyperplasia, and/or fibrotic stenosis. Currently, there are no therapies that can improve arteriovenous fistula early maturation failure by enhancing arteriovenous fistula outward remodeling, largely due to our nascent understanding of the mechanisms underlying vein adaptations to arteriovenous fistula hemodynamic stresses. Acute increases in shear stress and pulsatile pressure in the vein are normalized by rapid dilation followed by wall thickening. Venous smooth muscle cells (Venous smooth muscle cells) are the predominant cells sensing vessel wall stretch in response to increased flow volume and blood pressure. A significant barrier to progress is a deficit in our knowledge of the mechanisms by which Venous smooth muscle cells respond to arterial hemodynamics in early arteriovenous fistula adaptation. Strong evidence from both arteriovenous fistula mouse models and human sample studies demonstrate, for the first time, a role for differentiated Venous smooth muscle cells in arteriovenous fistula outward remodeling and maturation. This is further supported by new preliminary data from our clinically relevant 5/6-nephrectomy CKD arteriovenous fistula mouse model. We further show early arteriovenous fistula maturation involves Venous smooth muscle cells reprogramming from a quiescent to a previously uncharacterized proliferative, synthetic state that surprisingly retains differentiated contractile properties. Myocardin related transcription factor (transcription factor) A and B (MRtranscription factorA and B, MRtranscription factors) respond to cyclic stretch by transactivating multiple gene programs. VSMC-deficiency of MRtranscription factors impairs arteriovenous fistula maturation with reduced arteriovenous fistula wall thickness. Beyond the contractile gene program, MRtranscription factorA upregulates novel target genes (MMP2 and Atranscription factor3) to facilitate matrix remodeling and cell proliferation. This suggests that MRtranscription factors act as nodal transcription factors of vSMC reprogramming. CAMK2 is a major signal transducer poised to integrate stretch-induced vascular remodeling. Preliminary data show growth factors induce nuclear interaction of CAMK2 and MRtranscription factorA in cultured Venous smooth muscle cells. VSMC-deficiency of a major VSMC CAMK2 isoform, CAMK2D, phenocopies loss of VSMC MRtranscription factors, suggesting that CAMK2D transduces a signal(s) from arteriovenous fistula wall stress to trigger MRtranscription factor transactivity. These preliminary data support our central hypothesis that successful arteriovenous fistula adaptation and maturation involves CAMK2/MRtranscription factors-dependent vSMC reprogramming to a proliferative, matrix organizing, and contractile phenotype. Aim1 will elucidate mechanisms of vSMC-dependent arteriovenous fistula adaptive remodeling and maturation using Itga8CreERT2Confetti reporter, single nucleus (single nucleus) ATAC/RNA-seq, and spatial omics to determine vSMC clonal expansion and transcriptomics underlying arteriovenous fistula maturation. Aim 2 will use novel VSMC-specific MRtranscription factors and CAMK2D knockout mice to elucidate the mechanistic role of CAMK2D/MRtranscription factors in arteriovenous fistula maturation. Successful completion of these studies will provide novel insights into, and potential therapeutic targets for, arteriovenous fistula maturation failure attributable to inadequate vein adaption in humans.",5,5R01DK135284-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,8,2,0,0

This would be beneficial in fields such as neuroscience and oncology where many complex questions remain unanswered. The ability to map the locations of specific types of biomolecules within subcellular compartments would give insight into cellular organization and any altered state in disease. With the advent of expanding microscopy (expanding microscopy), it is now possible to obtain nanoscale images using only a diffraction-limited light microscope. This simple yet novel approach uses water-swellable polymers to physically expand biological specimens to be imaged at approximately 70 nm resolution. While the protocol for expansion and the retention of intracellular antigen have progressed rapidly since expanding microscopy was first developed, currently available methods are limited by linear expansion of 45 times of their original size. A higher expansion factor is needed to reveal the subtle changes in the size, shape, and texture ratio of subcellular organelles in health status or disease. More importantly, almost all the current expanding microscopy methods require a specific anchoring step to ensure targeted biomolecules are covalently linked to the newly synthesized hydrogel. A universal biomolecule anchor that works for thick tissues remains elusive. Additionally, few existing expanding microscopy approaches can expand diverse tissue types other than the brain without losing most of the epitopes. Thus there is tremendous pent-up demand for a method of nanoscale imaging for extended 3-D specimens and/or with highly versatile molecular contrast. Given its potential impact, we now propose a new framework called Magnify to bring the power and versatility of expanding microscopy to next generation.

This population is more likely to have disabilities, less likely to receive preventative care, and more likely to report unmet healthcare needs than children who live in urban areas. As such, they represent an underserved group at high risk for disparities in health outcomes. Children with complex or disabling health conditions may be at particular risk of adverse outcomes when they live in rural areas due to their chronic and multifaceted healthcare needs. However, at a population level we know extremely little about how urban-rural disparities in health care access impact this vulnerable population. The overall objective of this proposal is to comprehensively evaluate urban-rural disparities in health care utilization and quality for children with complex or disabling health conditions using five years of all-payer claims data from three states: Colorado, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. These states represent diverse populations with respect to geography, rurality, and race/ethnicity, making them ideally suited to the proposed analyses. We will conduct a retrospective cohort study of approximately 140,000 children to: (i) identify urban-rural disparities in ambulatory, emergency and inpatient healthcare utilization, (inpatient healthcare utilization,) characterize urban-rural disparities in healthcare quality, (inpatient healthcare utilization,i) identify community and health-system factors associated with urban-rural disparities in healthcare quality, and (iv) construct patient-sharing networks among physicians who care for these children to determine how patient-sharing networks differ between ruraland urban-residing children, and whether these differences are associated with disparities in quality of care. Construction of physician patient-sharing networks - that is, structural representations of relationships between physicians developed on the basis of shared patients -- provides a systematic approach to identify relationships between physicians that exist outside of formal organizational structures, which may be particularly relevant to children living in rural areas. In adult populations, network characteristics have been associated with resource utilization, practice patterns, and healthcare outcomes. However, this study will be the first to explore how physician networks differ between urbanand rural-residing children, characterizing a modifiable health system factor that may be leveraged in future work to reduce urban-rural disparities in their quality of care. This project will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team with clinical expertise providing care for children with medical complexity, as well as research expertise using all-payer claims data to evaluate healthcare quality and construct social networks. This research will generate essential data to inform the subsequent implementation and evaluation of interventions to reduce health disparities for rural-residing children with complex or disabling health conditions.",5,5R01MD014735-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES,1,3,3,2

Susceptibility to cardiometabolic diseases is highly variable, and currently no FDA-approved drugs exist to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Recent work suggests that cardiometabolic diseases share several genetic factors, and our long-term goal is to reveal the complex interplay between genomic and non-genomic risk factors in the development of disease to improve risk prediction and identify drug targets for repurposing to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In our first aim we will apply causal single and multiple causal mediation analysis in the UK Biobank to identify intermediate or moderating endophenotypes that can serve as potential intervention targets for type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We provide a framework for precision phenotyping and quantify how much individual-level genetic burden for disease can be reduced if one would intervene on intermediary endophenotypes. It may ultimately enable clinicians to detect early departures from patient-specific baseline risk that, while themselves are still asymptomatic, are predictive of the subsequent onset of disease symptoms. Our second aim is to identify and validate drug targets for potential repurposing in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease using genomic and real-world data. We will identify candidate drug targets using two approaches: 1) instrumental variable analysis using genetic instruments of the `druggable' genome (e.g., Mendelian Randomization analysis) and 2) a computational gene expression signature-based approach based on the knowledge of drug activity and disease pathophysiology. Predictive validity of drug efficacy for candidate drug targets will be assessed using real-world data of 9.1 million Veterans in the Veterans Health Administration healthcare system, 3.6 million patients in the Penn Medicine clinical data warehouse, and 3.5 million patients in the Vanderbilt Synthetic Derivative. Long-term therapeutic efficacy will be evaluated using emulated target trials in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients with cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, liver transplant, and liver cancer as the primary treatment endpoint during five years of follow-up. Short-term drug efficacy will be evaluated in healthy patients using self-controlled case series analysis with change in alanine transferase as the primary outcome. It is anticipated that our genomicsinformed and pharmaco-epidemiological approach to drug repurposing will accelerate drug-discovery efforts and lead to the use of existing agents to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with shortened drug development times.",5,5R01DK134575-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,12,2,0,0

Despite advances in corneal wound healing, individuals may develop blindness from scarring due to mechanical trauma, while others may experience a decline in the quality of light they perceive due to dry eye diseases, diabetic keratopathy, and neurotrophic diseases. Improper healing after corneal injury can result in decreased visual acuity, photophobia, pain, tearing, and ulcerations. Severe, treatment-resistant corneal epithelial defects include persistent corneal epithelial defect, estimated to cause 100,000 cases/year in the US, and recurrent corneal erosion, estimated to cause 4.23 cases/10,000 person-years. Novel treatments for corneal epithelial defects are urgently needed. The corneal epithelium is maintained by stem cells residing at the edge of the cornea in the limbus. These cells, known as limbal stem cells, give rise to basal epithelial progenitor cells, which migrate toward the central cornea and play a role in differentiation and stratification of the corneal epithelium to support homeostasis. A recent mouse lineage tracing study demonstrated that basal epithelial cell migration from the limbus is the initial step in central corneal wound healing, indicating that abnormal basal cell migration likely contributes to persistent corneal epithelial defects. In addition, studies have shown that disruption of extracellular matrix regulation, including the basement membrane, and focal adhesion molecules may be involved in recurrent corneal erosion. Thus, basal epithelial cells and their interaction with the surrounding microenvironment play an important role in maintaining a healthy corneal epithelium. We suggest that a critical balance in the heterogeneity of basal epithelial cells is required to support homeostasis and wound healing. Our objective is to identify novel therapeutic targets for corneal epithelial defects by revealing the differential roles of basal epithelial cells in the central cornea, limbus, and conjunctiva in corneal health and wound repair. We hypothesize that basal epithelial cells on the ocular surface have a specific molecular phenotype dependent on their location (central corneal, limbal, or conjunctival) and that the cells in each location differently contribute to homeostasis and wound healing of the corneal epithelium. The proposed study will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following aims. In Aim 1, we will reveal the precise heterogeneity of ocular surface basal epithelial cells and the mechanism underlying the transition from a limbal to central corneal cell phenotype. In Aim 2, we will determine the functional roles of genes expressed in basal epithelial cells in the central cornea. In Aim 3, we will determine the functional roles of genes expressed in basal epithelial cells in the limbus/conjunctiva. Our ultimate goal is to reveal the roles of each of the basal epithelial cell subpopulations during homeostasis and wound healing of the corneal epithelium, and identify new candidate targets for the treatment of severe corneal epithelial defects.",1,1R01EY036399-01,PA-20-185,NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE,18,13,9,1

In part through progress during the 20-yr tenure of this grant, we know that glutamatergic projections from cortical and allocortical brain regions to the nucleus accumbens core (nucleus accumbens core) and GABAergic nucleus accumbens core projections to the dorsolateral ventral pallidum (dorsolateral ventral pallidum) are necessary for executing cue-induced cocaine seeking and extinction training-induced refraining from cocaine seeking. Classically, projections from the striatum contain two neuronal subtypes, those projecting to the ventral mesencephalon selectively expressing D1 dopamine receptors (D1-MSNs) and those projecting to the palldum expressing D2 receptors (D2-MSNs). Through work on this grant, we now know that nucleus accumbens core D1-MSNs also innervate the dorsolateral ventral pallidum1, and that activity in this D1-MSN to dorsolateral ventral pallidum subcircuit is necessary for cueinduced cocaine seeking. Also, we discovered that activity in D2-MSNs is associated with extinction-induced refraining from cocaine seeking. Akin to the nucleus accumbens core, the dorsolateral ventral pallidum contains two primary cell types, one expressing glutamate (VPglu) and the other expressing GABA (VPglu) and the other expressing GABA). Also, a subpopulation of VPglu) and the other expressing GABA co-express enkephalin (VPGABA co-express enkephalin). We have begun to study the dorsolateral ventral pallidum subcircuits coded by these distinct dorsolateral ventral pallidum neuronal subtypes in regulating cocaine seeking and refraining from seeking. Cell-type specific chemogenetic stimulation reveals that VPglu inhibit reinstated cocaine seeking and stimulating VPGABA co-express enkephalin induces cocaine seeking. Surprisingly, VPglu and VPglu) and the other expressing GABA cells in dorsolateral ventral pallidum have different axon terminal fields. These findings indicate distinct roles for the different dorsolateral ventral pallidum neuronal subtypes, and that divergent roles for subtype selective projections emanating from the dorsolateral ventral pallidum is likely. We propose to disentangle the circuitry in which the dorsolateral ventral pallidum is embedded using a combination of behavior, in vivo calcium imaging and slice electrophysiology, and test the hypothesis that VPglu activity promotes refraining during extinction responding, while VPGABA co-express enkephalin codes for cocaine seeking.",5,5R01DA012513-25,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,0,1,5,1

Using genetic approaches, we demonstrated that mitochondrial complex I, an entry point of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, specifically controls the sensitivity of multiple species, including worms and humans, to volatile anesthetics. These broad phylogenetic effects indicate that an ancient mechanism is at hand, linking mitochondrial function to synaptic silencing in the presence of volatile anesthetics. We began mechanistic studies in mice by exploiting Ndufs4(KO), a mouse defective in complex I function and extremely hypersensitive to volatile anesthetics. Testing cell-specific Ndufs4(KO) mice, we found that VA sensitivity was fully controlled by glutamatergic KO, with no effect of loss of NDUFS4 from GABAergic or cholinergic neurons. Surprisingly, an astrocytic-specific KO of NDUFS4 was defective only in arousal from volatile anesthetics. Preliminary data indicate that neurons in the locus coeruleus mediate this effect. This novel role of astrocytes offers a new approach to investigate crucial arousal pathways. In addition, we are exploring the mechanisms underlying anesthetic induced neurotoxicity (anesthetic induced neurotoxicity). From our work in nematodes, we have identified new candidate molecules that can be tested as anesthetic induced neurotoxicity therapies in mice. We showed that inhibition of the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum, or inhibition of mTOR, a cellular metabolic switch, alleviated anesthetic induced neurotoxicity in worms. We are exploring the roles of these pathways in anesthetic induced neurotoxicity, and relating them to exciting new data which indicate that volatile anesthetics themselves produce metabolic changes specific to neonatal mice. Many questions remain unanswered. 1. How do complex I defects control VA sensitivity. We showed that excitatory neurotransmission in Ndufs4(KO) was hypersensitive to isoflurane inhibition compared to WT. Our recent data suggest that isoflurane inhibits synaptic endocytosis in both WT and KO animals and that this inhibition results from a decrease in ATP production. Our aims are to characterize the mechanism underlying inhibition of neurotransmitter endocytosis by volatile anesthetics. 2. What pathways transduce anesthetic induced neurotoxicity in neonatal mice; how can those pathways be inhibited? We are extending C. elegans studies to test exciting new small molecule candidates that may alleviate anesthetic induced neurotoxicity in mice. We are also exploring ER-stress and mTOR activity as potential signaling pathways mediating anesthetic induced neurotoxicity in mice. 3. How does mitochondrial function in astrocytes control arousal from the anesthetized state? We are studying astrocyte signaling to determine how astrocytes affect synaptic function during and following VA exposure. Astrocyte/neural pathways necessary for emergence from the anesthetized state will be investigated. Mitochondrial function is linked to behavior in volatile anesthetics in worms, mice, and man.

Advances in targeted and immune therapies now often require more tissue for molecular and immune profiling to optimally manage lung cancer. The yield for cancer diagnosis using modern bronchoscopic tools approaches only 50% across the spectrum of lung tumors biopsied, and the additional requirement for molecular and immune profiling erodes this yield further. This leads to delayed and suboptimal care, increased healthcare costs, and increased patient morbidity since patients can often require multiple procedures to obtain the correct information for treatment. Our group has recently demonstrated that targeted Bronchoalveolar Lavage (Bronchoalveolar Lavage) - or a washing of the lung cancer performed during a procedure - is a reservoir of genomic and cellular biomarkers in the lung tumor macroenvironment (tumor macroenvironment). Further, we have demonstrated that molecular analyses of Bronchoalveolar Lavage from the lung tumor macroenvironment recapitulate cancer biology in the lung tumor microenvironment (tumor microenvironment). While Bronchoalveolar Lavage is very safe and routinely performed during bronchoscopy, to date, it is a pauci-cellular fluid that is of limited clinical utility for cancer diagnosis. Beyond cytology that is low yield, there are no molecular or cellular assays that are used in the clinic to fully inform providers who treat lung cancer. Because of this, rigorous attention to how methods of collection, patient host factors and processing of Bronchoalveolar Lavage will alter genomic and high dimensional cell based assays is lacking. Our central hypothesis is: Bronchoalveolar Lavage globally samples the tumor microenvironment (tumor microenvironment) to overcome limitations of tumor heterogeneity and is more sensitive than blood for immunogenomic profiling due to increased quantities of tumor specific biomarkers. To realize our goal and prove our hypothesis, in depth analysis of the conditions affecting Bronchoalveolar Lavage for high dimensional genome and cell assays is required. Here, we propose studying how basic conditions in the lung, variations in acquisition of Bronchoalveolar Lavage, and storage and processing of Bronchoalveolar Lavage affect its utility for comprehensive genome profiling and analysis of the T cell repertoire. Following identification of key pre-analytic variables, we propose a standard operating procedure for implementation in observational biomarker and first-in-man clinical trials to demonstrate the clinical utility of our approach. Proposal success will facilitate the introduction of novel molecular assays into the clinic that augment extant and developing blood and tumor assays. This approach will be particularly relevant as we move into the era of precision guided therapies for lung cancer treatment, which have begun to reduce mortality in even the most advanced stages, over the coming years and decades.",5,5U01CA253166-06,PAR-18-947,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,17,0,4,4

Paradoxically, aggregationprone proteins are expressed in both neurons and astrocytes, yet neurons appear more vulnerable to the accumulation of protein aggregates. These observations suggest cell-type-specific differences in how quality control pathways are managed in neurons and astrocytes to regulate the integrity of the proteome. In fact, we have found striking differences in how the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and the ubiquitin-proteasome system are managed between neurons and astrocytes. Despite this knowledge, a comprehensive understanding of the cell-type-specific pathways for regulating proteostasis in neurons versus astrocytes has not been achieved. Moreover, the relationship between neurons and astrocytes in the context of proteotoxic stress is largely unknown. It is well established that astrocytes play critical roles in neuronal homeostasis, function, and neuroprotection. By contrast, astrocytes are also emerging as key players in disease (AD pathogenesis. However, we are only at the inception of understanding the molecular and functional properties of neuron-astrocyte interactions in health and disease (AD. Thus, this proposal will define the regulation of lysosome-mediated pathways (autophagy and endolysosomal) within (Aim 1) and between (Aim 2) astrocytes and neurons in response to proteotoxic stress elicited by fibrillar forms of a-synuclein, a model for a-synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease (AD. To elucidate cell-type-specific responses, we developed a robust system to coculture primary neurons and astrocytes that recapitulates morphological, proteomic, and functional signatures of astrocytes in vivo. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that autophagy and lysosomal pathways are adapted differently in astrocytes versus neurons, which may render neurons preferentially vulnerable to proteotoxic stress associated with a-synuclein aggregation. To test this hypothesis, we will  define the sequence of degradation of a-synuclein fibrils via lysosomemediated pathways within astrocytes as compared with neurons, and  define the role of the autophagy receptor TAX1BP1 in the coupling of neuron-astrocyte stress responses to a-synuclein proteotoxins. We employ live-cell imaging combined with quantitative cell biology and biochemistry to investigate these processes at high spatiotemporal resolution in a compartment-specific manner.

Critical mechanistic insight into these processes will be obtained through comparative studies in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis by leveraging the differences of these two systems. RNA polymerase pausing and transcription termination are fundamental events that regulate gene expression in all organisms. NusA and NusG are general transcription elongation factors that have remarkable flexibility in how they respond to pause and termination signals in bacteria, and we will determine how these two proteins collaborate to maintain proper expression of the genome. Using RNET-seq, we identified 1600 NusG-dependent pause sites throughout the B. subtilis genome. ~25% of these pause sites are in 5'UTRs, and the role that several of these pauses have in regulating gene expression will be examined. The other 75% of the pause sites are in open reading frames and the possibility that these pauses are involved in maintaining coupling of transcription and translation will be tested. In addition, the structural basis for NusG-dependent pausing, and the cooperativity of NusA and NusG in this process, will be investigated using cryo-EM. Whereas the KOW domain of E. coli NusG interacts with ribosomal protein S10 for coupling of transcription and translation, this type of coupling does not take place in B. subtilis, and the role of the B. subtilis KOW domain is unknown. However, our preliminary results implicate this domain in co-transcriptional tRNA processing, and this exciting possibility will be examined. Although E. coli NusG functions as an anti-pausing factor, the transcriptome-wide role of NusA on pausing has not been examined and we will do so. Intrinsic transcription terminators consist of an RNA hairpin followed by a U-rich tract. Using Term-seq we showed that NusA, NusG and Rho function as intrinsic termination factors in B. subtilis. However, the roles that these proteins play in intrinsic termination in E. coli are unknown, and we will determine those functions using engineered depletion strains for each protein. CsrA is a conserved RNA binding protein that binds to and regulates hundreds of mRNAs by affecting their translation and decay. Our work indicates that it regulates numerous cellular processes, suggesting that it is a master regulator of multiple stress responses. The extent of this regulon and how it affects metabolic changes will be explored using a combination of in vivo CsrA-RNA footprinting, metabolomics, and regulatory studies. Of particular importance, the footprinting methods will be applicable to essentially any organism or cell type.

This gene is implicated in heterogeneous glaucoma phenotypes, including human primary congenital glaucoma (primary congenital glaucoma) as well as some forms of adult-onset open angle glaucoma. As the only known large animal homolog of inherited glaucoma in humans, this model has considerable potential for translational research. Posterior segment pathology has been extensively characterized and closely recapitulates features of human glaucomatous optic neuropathy. However, the role played by LTBP2 in the eye remains unknown and the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the underlying elevated intraocular pressure (intraocular pressure) in this form of glaucoma remain unresolved. The objective of this proposal is to identify and localize, as potential targets for therapeutic intervention, key pathobiological mechanisms that contribute to both early onset and progressive intraocular pressure elevation in this model. In addition to perturbing LTBP2's acknowledged role in microfibril assembly, enhanced TGF beta signaling, contributing to extracellular matrix (extracellular matrix) accumulation within the trabecular meshwork (trabecular meshwork) has been proposed as a mechanism for intraocular pressure elevation in this ""microfibrillopathy"". However, preliminary studies in our animal model have not established whether significant increase in aqueous humor TGF beta concentrations represent a cause or effect of intraocular pressure elevation. Our central hypothesis is that LTBP2 is both an important regulator of outflow pathway development and remodeling in the perinatal period and a regulator of trabecular meshwork cell and extracellular matrix biology and pro-fibrotic pathways throughout life, extending beyond development. We will pursue two specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine the effects of absent or reduced LTBP2 expression on development of proximal and distal aqueous outflow pathways, we will test the hypothesis that LTBP2 plays an important role in outflow pathway development and remodeling using a combination of in vivo and in situ approaches to examine distal outflow morphology and ultrastructure of the proximal outflow pathway (trabecular meshwork and juxtacanalicular tissue) and extracellular matrix components of these pathways in wildtype and LTBP2+/- and LTBP2-/- eyes. Aim 2: To determine the pathological effects of absent or reduced LTBP2 expression on trabecular meshwork cell (trabecular meshworkC) biology, we will use trabecular meshworkC cultures derived from wildtype, LTBP2+/- and LTBP2-/- eyes. In Aim 2, we will test the hypotheses that reduced LTBP2 expression will a) negatively impact trabecular meshworkC attachment and proliferation in vitro and b) enhance the pathologic effects of TGFβ on actin cytoskeleton and promotion of extracellular matrix fibrosis.

Most studies of the apicomplexan mitochondrion have focused on its biochemistry and physiology. By contrast little is known about the machinery that controls mitochondrial division and that regulate its structure, information that would be critical for a thorough exploration of the mitochondrion as a drug target. Toxoplasma's singular mitochondrion is very dynamic and undergoes morphological changes throughout the parasite's life cycle including during the transition from the intracellular to the extracellular environment. While inside a host cell the mitochondrion is maintained in a lasso shape that stretches around the parasite periphery where it has regions of coupling with the parasite pellicle, suggesting the presence of membrane contact sites. Promptly after exit from the host cell, these contact sites disappear, and the mitochondrion collapses indicating that dynamic membrane contact sites regulate the positioning of the mitochondrion. Neither the functional significance nor the proteins needed for the contact between Toxoplasma's mitochondrion and pellicle are known. We have discovered a novel protein, Fip1, that associates with the mitochondrion and that when knocked out the normal morphology of the mitochondrion is severely affected. In intracellular fip1 knockout parasites the mitochondrion is not in a lasso shape as seen in wildtype parasites, but instead it is collapsed. Additionally, proper mitochondrial segregation is disrupted in the knockout parasites, resulting in parasites with no mitochondrion and mitochondrial material outside of the parasites. These gross morphological changes are associated with a significant reduction of parasite propagation and can be rescued by reintroduction of a wildtype copy of Fip1. Accordingly, we hypothesize that Fip1 mediates contact between the mitochondrion and the parasite pellicle in a regulatable fashion, and that the Fip1 dependent mitochondrial morphology and dynamics are critical for parasite propagation. Through a combination of molecular genetics, microscopy and proteomics we will address the functional relevance and the mechanics of the mitochondrial morphology. In aim one we will conduct a thorough in vivo and in vitro phenotypic characterization of Fip1 mutant strains to determine the role of Fip1 and mitochondrial shape in parasite viability. Aim two focuses on identifying and characterizing components of the Fip1 complex that mediates the association of the mitochondrion with the periphery of the parasites. Finally, in aim three we will determine the regulatory mechanisms that drive the mitochondrial morphological changes as the parasite exits its host cell. In conjunction, these experiments will shed light onto the molecular mechanisms driving and regulating the morphodynamics of the Toxoplasma mitochondrion.

Uncovering the functional role of these stem cells and how they interact with other cell types in the niche can provide insight in to the mechanisms that mediate hippocampal cognitive-emotional functions, as well as potential mechanisms for regenerating tissue in the adult brain. Recently, stem cell secreted proteins (i.e. the stem cell secretome) have emerged as influential players in tissue homeostasis. However, relatively little is known about either the content or the function of the secretome of endogenous neural stem cells and their progenitors (NSPCs) in the adult hippocampus. Our preliminary data reveal that adult hippocampal NSPCs may regulate their microenvironment through the production of the soluble protein, vascular endothelial growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor). We find that NSPCs synthesize large quantities of vascular endothelial growth factor in their hippocampal niche and that NSPC-derived vascular endothelial growth factor is necessary for sustaining healthy hippocampal function. We propose to investigate the hypothesis that NSPCs support hippocampal function by direct actions of vascular endothelial growth factor that suppress neuronal hyperexcitability, ultimately supporting memory function, as well as protecting it from injury. In Aim 1, we will use RNAsequencing as well as genetic code expansion coupled with biorthogonal noncanonical amino acid protein tagging to determine the specific local contributions of NSPCs to vascular endothelial growth factor isoforms in the cell layers of the dentate gyrus subregion where these cells reside. In Aim 2, we will use transgenic knockdown and viral rescue models to investigate how dentate gyrus circuit activity is regulated specifically by NSPC-derived vascular endothelial growth factor. In Aim 3, we will use transgenic knockdown and viral rescue models to determine how NSPC-vascular endothelial growth factor influences hippocampal behavioral functions and vulnerability to excitotoxic injury.

Although vaccine regimens in clinical trials show various levels of protection against HIV, there is no effective vaccine available for a large population yet. Preclinical and clinical data demonstrate the importance of both adjuvants and antigens for an effective HIV vaccine. Particularly, stimulation of toll-like receptors (toll-like receptors) or stimulator of interferon genes (stimulator of interferon genes) boosts the immune response of the HIV antigens in multiple animal models. Meanwhile, HIV immunogens are a critical factor for both humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity such as broadly neutralizing antibodies (broadly neutralizing antibodies) and cytotoxic T cells. Despite these important advances, significant challenges remain in immunogen design, immunogen delivery, and adjuvant choice. To overcome these challenges, we propose to integrate adjuvant derived nanoparticles and engineered mRNA for HIV vaccine discovery. In preliminary studies, we developed adjuvant derived nanoparticles (adjuvant derived nanoparticles) using TLR or stimulator of interferon genes agonists, which showed great potential for efficient mRNA delivery as a vaccine platform. Moreover, we constructed glycosylated HIV immunogens that trigger mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-mediated innate immune recognition, leading to enhanced antibody responses. Additionally, we systematically investigated the untranslated regions (untranslated regions) of mRNAs in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of untranslated regions, we identified the optimal combination of 5' and 3' UTR for mRNA engineering. Based on these results and findings, the goal of this proposed project is to develop adjuvant derived nanoparticles as functional nanomaterials capable of efficiently delivering HIV immunogens in vivo, consequently generating strong and durable humoral and cell-mediated immunity against HIV. The following specific aims will be carried out to accomplish our goal: 1) Synthesis and characterization of adjuvant derived nanoparticles (adjuvant derived nanoparticles); 2) Engineering of mRNA transcripts encoding various HIV immunogens with high translation efficiency; and 3) Determination of immunogenicity and safety profiles of adjuvant derived nanoparticles-mRNA in mouse and non-human primate models. Encouraged by results from our preliminary studies, we expect the newly designed nanomaterials from this proposal to establish a vaccine candidate, which can facilitate clinical translation and a new avenue for HIV vaccine discovery. Knowledge gained from this study can also be extended to other types of vaccines for emerging pathogens.",5,5R01AI174902-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

Importantly, there is also a strong connection between unfolded protein response and inflammation or neuronal health. Many neurodegenerative diseases and diseases of aging have connections to the unfolded protein response. We have recently discovered a new form of BiP regulation, adenosine monophosphateylation by the protein Fic. We observe that Fic adds an adenosine monophosphate (adenosine monophosphate) molecule to a threonine near the ATP binding site of BiP during normal growth conditions. This modification rapidly is removed by the same enzyme Fic under multiple endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducing conditions. We recently have shown that the regulation of BiP by Fic is essential for maintaining neuronal homeostasis. Since our discovery of Fic domains that mediate adenosine monophosphateylation, other diverse activities performed by bacterial Fic domains have been identified. These studies have revealed the molecular plasticity of Fic domains in its ability to utilize diverse substrates. Despite these studies, there are many different Fic proteins that remain to be characterized, both in catalytic activity, biological function, and molecular targets. We propose three projects that will further our understanding of the biology of Fic enzymes and the chemistry they use, both in vitro and in vivo. First, when the endoplasmic reticulum is stressed, Fic changes from an adenosine monophosphateylator to a deadenosine monophosphateylator, and the key to this regulation is breaking a salt bridge in Fic's active site. We want to understand the biochemistry regulating this switch. Second, our studies with Drosophila genetics show that Fic is required for neuronal plasticity. We are therefore interested in understanding what role Fic plays in mammalian biology using transgenic mice. Third, there are many different Fic proteins that remain to be characterized, both in catalytic activity, biological function, and molecular targets. We plan to investigate these orphan Fic domains and identify their biological activities and substrates.",5,5R35GM134945-05,PAR-17-094,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

These strategies include genetic methods to render immune cells resistant to infection or to enhance immune effector cell anti-HIV activity. In this latter instance, genetic engineering of B cells has provided a highly novel means to achieve vectored immunotherapy for production of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies (broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies). Of note, the exceptional utilities of gene editing have been successfully employed to achieve precision genome modification of B cells to accomplish this technical end. In this approach, primary mature B cells from the periphery are modified to express HIV broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies as functional antigen receptors spliced to cell endogenous heavy chain constant genes. These cells are then expanded and affinity-matured, using vaccines or viral antigen in vivo, resulting in the elicitation of durable, self-tolerant, and isotyped-switched broadly neutralizing antibodies and memory. Here-to-fore this promising B cell approach has mandated ex vivo genetic modification to practically accomplish effective cell engineering. This facet of the strategy thereby entrains technical and methodological complexities practically limiting this approach. Clearly, the ability to accomplish genetic modification of B cells in vivo would render this approach of greater applicability and accessibility. Further to this end, the ability to achieve such in vivo B cell transduction, in an efficient and selective manner, would be key to realizing the benefits of this technology with an acceptable margin of safety. To this end, we have explored the utilities of replication defective adenoviral vectors (adenoviral vectors) to address the mandates for in vivo transduction of B cells. In this regard, we have developed a novel ""triple targeting"" approach that allows efficient and selective gene delivery to key target cells in vivo. In addition, adenovirus provides a unique framework for effective and economical in vivo delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 and donor DNA for targeted integration of bnAb genes into the B cell genome by homology directed repair in situ. Of additional note, the use of non-human primate adenoviral vectorss allows derivation of vectors that can traverse immune barriers to human adenovirus-based vectors. In the aggregate, these combined facets of adenovirus provide the critical functional capacities allowing us to address the mandates of an in vivo applied anti-HIV B cell vectored immunotherapy strategy.",1,1R01AI174270-01A1,RFA-AI-20-076,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

Most of these approaches are being studied and evaluated by using laboratory-based in vitro and rodent models in the context of malaria transmission dynamics, because to date there is no experimentally easy and affordable human Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission model. Furthermore, the small number of in vitro-cultured P. falciparum strains capable of infecting mosquitoes represent another obstacle in the study of mosquito stages of P. falciparum infection. To maintain gametocytogenesis and mosquito infectivity, asexually grown P. falciparum cultures should either be maintained at low passage number or should be passaged through infection cycles in the mosquito vector, but these strategies also require a malaria transmission model comprising the entire human infection cycle. We have recently advanced the development of an existing humanized mouse model to enable the complete P. falciparum infection cycle, from gametocyte to gametocyte. Here we will further this achievement into a standardized, affordable and accessible human malaria infection model, thereby closing a critical gap in malaria transmission studies. In aim 1 we will explore the utility of the humanized mouse-based P. falciparum transmission model with various malaria vector species and P. falciparum isolates.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) is a major health crisis with no approved therapeutics and many failures in the clinic. The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is estimated to increase from 25% of the US population in 2015 (~83 million) to over 100 million by 2030, accompanied by an increase in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), the progressive form of the disease, that can lead to cirrhosis with liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatocellular carcinoma). Despite its public health importance, there is currently no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a complex heterogeneous disorder involving multiple molecular pathways. Development of efficacious pharmacotherapy has been hampered by the limited utility of preclinical drug testing models. Simple cell culture and animal models do not recapitulate the spectrum of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis phenotypes in humans. Highlighting these species differences, knock-in murine models with the high-risk nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-associated genetic polymorphism, PNPLA3 I148M, develop hepatic steatosis but do not recapitulate the progressive disease seen in humans. Additionally, heterogeneity in risk of progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, individual genetic variations modulating risk of fibrosis progression, and presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-associated metabolic comorbidities such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 diabetes mellitus), adds additional complexity. We will implement the vascularized patient-derived iPSC liver acinus microphysiology system to initially characterize both a ""normal"" and a nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis vascularized patient-derived iPSC liver acinus microphysiology system generated from primary human liver cells (hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, stellate and Kupffer cells) and then reproduce the results with induced pluripotent stem cells (induced pluripotent stem cells). We will ultimately generate patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells of the four cell types from patients in our nonalcoholic fatty liver disease clinic to create patient-specific vascularized patient-derived iPSC liver acinus microphysiology system. We will test two cohorts: 1) patients with the PNPLA3 I 148M variant and 2) patients with the wild-type PNPLA3 to identify the patients who respond to two nonalcoholic fatty liver disease drugs that have or are now going through clinical trials and two control drugs. Importantly, this paradigm circumvents the conundrum of high-risk patients being enrolled in large prolonged studies with a high likelihood of failure being simultaneously disqualified from other potentially beneficial studies/treatments. This approach will prove transformational for clinical trial design by enriching for subjects most likely to benefit from a therapy, and in the future, after more than one currently investigational drugs are approved, for precision medicine to identify the most efficacious therapy for high-risk subgroups.",5,5UH3TR003289-05,RFA-TR-19-014,NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES,12,2,0,0

However, aberrant cell signaling events caused by dysregulation of protein modifications often lead to altered protein homeostasis and cellular function to facilitate the development of human diseases including cancer. In keeping with a critical role for these modifications to governing tumorigenesis, inhibitors targeting enzymes regulating these post-translational modifications have attracted extensive attention as biomarkers and anti-cancer drug targets. To this end, the heart of my laboratory has been focused on studying the regulatory mechanisms and physiological functions of two major multi-component protein enzyme complexes: Cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes and the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex), as well as their interplay with other cell signaling pathways to govern cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis. The long-term goal of my research program is to understand how aberrant cell signaling pathways including phosphorylation and ubiquitination influence tumorigenesis, which guides the identification of novel drug targets for treating human cancers. Over the past thirteen years of independence, my laboratory has established an outstanding track record of original, cutting-edge, research in the cell cycle and cancer signaling fields. In this proposal, I have expanded our research by further deciphering the role of ubiquitination in regulating the Mammalian Target of Rapamycin ComplexC1 signaling pathway, as well as the interplay between ubiquitination and phosphorylation signaling pathways to govern tumorigenesis, thereby providing mechanistic insights and the rationale to develop inhibitors targeting key modules of cell signaling pathways including E3 ligases and kinases to enhance our capability of creating highly targeted cancer therapies. To achieve these goals, one major theme is to use both biochemical and genetic approaches to understand the oncogenic role of Skp2 and the tumor suppressive role of Fbw7 in part via modulating cell metabolism through ubiquitination-mediated pathways. The second major theme of this proposal aims to investigate the physiological and pathological impacts of GATOR2-mediated ubiquitination of GATOR1 signaling events during cancer development in vivo, which will guide us to uncover novel therapeutic opportunities targeting these signaling pathways. This prestigious award would therefore provide us the necessary resources to use highly innovative approaches to tackle challenging questions such as understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing tumorigenesis to shed light on novel pathways to target cancer more effectively. Receiving this prestigious award at this stage of my career will allow my laboratory to concentrate more on innovative lab research to continue to make breakthrough discoveries to impact development of the next generation of cancer therapeutics. !",5,5R35CA253027-05,PAR-19-349,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,5,14,2,0

Transdermal sensors, which measure alcohol consumption by assessing the alcohol content of insensible perspiration, offer a uniquely non-invasive, passive, and low-cost method for the continuous assessment of drinking likely to be attractive to a range of populations. But the relationship between transdermal alcohol concentration (transdermal alcohol concentration) and blood alcohol concentration (blood alcohol concentration) is highly complex, varying across individuals and contexts and involving some degree of lag time. Prior research, which has featured extremely small participant samples and examined old-generation transdermal devices, has been poorly suited to modeling this complexity. Thus, scientists are left with little sense for how to translate data produced by transdermal sensors into estimates of blood alcohol concentration. Importantly, the past decade has seen remarkable technological and analytic developments, offering the potential to tackle the challenge of transdermal alcohol concentration-blood alcohol concentration translation. In particular, in recent years, machine learning approaches have been developed that are particularly well suited to modeling highly complex and time-lagged relationships within larger datasets. Also during this time period, a new generation of transdermal device has come under development, featuring sleek/compact designs, smartphone integration, and capabilities for sampling transdermal alcohol concentration at approximately 90 times the rate of older-generation devices. These sensors thus provide a rich source of data for machine learning models and also, for the first time, the potential to produce transdermal blood alcohol concentration estimates in real time. The proposed research leverages machine learning, novel transdermal technology, and large-scale multimodal human testing to translate transdermal sensor data into estimates of blood alcohol concentration. Transdermal sensors will be examined in the context of multimodal research featuring a large and diverse participant sample (N=240) examined both inside and outside the laboratory. The ambulatory arm of the proposed project is aimed at capturing the transdermal alcohol concentration-blood alcohol concentration relationship across individuals in varying real-world drinking contexts, examining regular drinkers wearing new-generation transdermal sensors in everyday settings while providing prompted breathalyzer readings. This ambulatory research will be complemented by a laboratory study arm, aimed at examining the transdermal alcohol concentration-blood alcohol concentration relationship among individuals drinking in a controlled setting while alcohol dose and rate of consumption are systematically manipulated. Machine learning algorithms, including deep neural network models, will be used to create estimates of blood alcohol concentration from transdermal sensor data. These estimates will be examined in terms of their accuracy, temporal specificity, and also context-dependence. Thus, results will carry significance for addiction science by translating transdermal sensor data and clarifying the place of these sensors in our arsenal of techniques for assessing, preventing, and treating problem drinking.",5,5R01AA028488-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM,6,5,8,2

Current methods to treat these conditions rely on procedures to harvest and implant bone autografts, which are costly, invasive and difficult to scale up. The other alternatives are synthetic bone replacement materials, which show high failure rates and fail to mimic the native bone structure, composition and osteogenic properties. Stem cell-based tissue engineering has long been proposed as a promising alternative for the repair of bone defects. However, treating large bony structures remains problematic. It is generally believed that scaffold materials that closely approximate the characteristics of native bone represent improved materials for bone regeneration. However, the development of in-vitro scaffolds mimicking the highly vascularized, innervated, and mineralized cell-rich bone matrix down to the nanoscale has remained elusive to date. Here, we will develop a new bone scaffold biomanufacturing process where osteoprogenitor cells are three-dimensionally embedded in controlled nano-mineralized, pre-vascularized and innervated bone-like injectable microgels, thus mimicking the mineralized nanostructure, cellular and extracellular microenvironment of native bone. (aim 1) We will determine the mechanistic characteristics enabling the differentiation of hMSCs into osteogenic phenotypes as influenced by bone-like microenvironments, and engineer cell-laden mineralized injectable microgels that approximate the regenerative potential of autologous bone grafts. We will then adapt this strategy to engineer (aim 2) pericyte-supported vascular capillaries and (aim 3) neuronal networks, that are embedded in nanoscale mineralized hydrogels, to determine the mechanisms that enable vasculature and innervation enhancement of osteogenesis in-vitro and regeneration in-vivo. We argue that this multi-pronged strategy will enable the engineering of highly innovative bone scaffold materials and in-vitro bone model systems that will share great nanostructural and physical similarities to native bone.

This damage underlies diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration, and when caused by prescription drugs, leads to toxic side effects limiting usage. To cope with these proteotoxic stresses, cells express molecular chaperones, co-chaperones, and a variety of additional support proteins - collectively referred to as the proteostasis network (proteostasis network) - that are integral for the proper synthesis, folding, stability and degradation of the cellular proteome. Thus, understanding the regulation and function of the proteostasis network is critically important in understanding its role in the interface between disease susceptibility and exposure to environmental stressors. We previously developed a broadly applicable framework and online resource (FIREWORKS) to interrogate biological networks using unbiased genetic screens. Using our FIREWORKS framework, we mapped the constituents of and relationships between stress response pathways in human cells coping with growth-related molecular stresses revealing a network of 146 genes with vital functions spanning diverse stress contexts. Here, we propose to expand this resource to create an unbiased and global map of the response to environmental proteotoxic stress. We will integrate our cutting-edge chemical-genetic screening platform with our FIREWORKS computational pipeline to identify components, function, and regulatory nodes critical for the cellular response to environmental stressors. In parallel, we will identify transcriptional changes that occur immediately and throughout longer periods of environmental stress exposure, to provide a framework for understanding cellular adaptation to these stressors.

A common but understudied type of multivalent IDP assembly exhibits a unique duplex topology, characterized by parallel alignment of two IDP chains reversibly cross-linked by the ubiquitous LC8 hub protein, where the intrinsically disordered proteins allosterically enhance affinity for additional bivalent ligands. These duplexes can serve as a girder-like element in large complexes, act as sensors, and facilitate or `template' the formation of large supra-molecular assemblies (such as the dynein motor and nucleopore complex). Key features of these systems were identified in MPI Barbar's lab, but studies of the structural and biochemical basis for this wide range of functionalities are challenged by the diversity, internal mobility, and heterogeneity of the complexes formed. This proposal will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of multivalent LC8 complex assemblies, by integrating an array of novel and existing methods of computational modeling - such as weighted-ensemble molecular dynamics simulation - with experiments including isothermal titration calorimetry (isothermal titration calorimetry) and surface plasmon resonance (surface plasmon resonance), and structural characterization such as nuclear magnetic resonance (nuclear magnetic resonance), electron microscopy (electron microscopy), and native mass spectrometry (native mass spectrometry). These techniques were selected to address critical unanswered questions in the field: How much conformational and compositional heterogeneity is intrinsic to these reversibly assembled duplexes, and how do they avoid a disordered state? How does LC8 concentration, which is tightly controlled by the cell, modulate the heterogeneity? What do the allosteric effects and associated mechanistic pathways indicate about regulation of the duplexes? What differences are observed among duplex systems optimized for architectural vs. complex-scaffolding vs. sensing roles? To address these questions, three largely independent aims will probe the ensemble thermodynamics via isothermal titration calorimetry and theory dissecting species populations, the conformational ensemble via electron microscopy and theory from whole complexto atomistic-scale, and finally the atomistic basis of kinetic and cooperative behavior via simulations and kinetics measurements. The efforts will be guided by an experienced biophysics team with a wide-range of complementary expertise who have been collaborating for several years - experts in theoretical biophysics (Zuckerman, MPI); in LC8 structural biology, isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance (Barbar, MPI); in electron microscopy (Reichow, Co-I); and in native mass spectrometry (Prell, Co-I).

Crucial for this is our gap in knowledge regarding mechanisms linking bioenergetic stimulation to muscle anabolism. Glucocorticoid steroids have pervasive effects on energy metabolism and muscle function. Dosing intermittence appears crucial to the benefits/risks ratio of these drugs in dystrophic animal models and patients, i.e. in genetic myopathies. Here we investigate whether intermittent glucocorticoids increase performance in aged muscle, where weakness and sarcopenia are not dependent on specific genetic insults. Our new results in 24 months-old WT mice show that a chronic regimen of intermittent once-weekly prednisone increased muscle performance in aging mice to levels comparable to young adult mice (4 monthsold). Remarkably, treatment rescued both mitochondrial respiration and muscle mass in aging mice to younglike levels. Mechanistically, we found that bioenergetic, functional and anabolic effects of intermittent prednisone were blunted upon inducible ablation of PGC1a in adult muscle. While the role of PGC1a in boosting mitochondrial capacity in aged muscle is more established, its effects on age-related sarcopenia and weakness are still debated with conflicting results from constitutive knockout or overexpression models. Scattered reports have hinted at a role of PGC1a in activating growth pathways, including biosynthesis of amino acids like alanine, but this is still largely unknown in muscle aging. Here we will investigate the mechanisms through which a bioenergetic stimulation like intermittent prednisone rescues both oxidative metabolism and mass gain in muscle aging. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which intermittence discriminates deleterious versus beneficial effects of glucocorticoids in aging muscle. We hypothesize that dosing intermittence shifts exogenous glucocorticoid effects from a PGC1a-lowering pro-wasting program to a PGC1a-dependent pro-ergogenic program, i.e. balanced gain of performance and mass. We will test this through inducible muscle-specific PGC1a ablation after natural aging. In Aim 2 we will establish the role of muscle Lipin1 in PGC1a re-activation in muscle aging. We hypothesize that Lipin1 supports mitochondrial function in muscle aging and mediates the PGC1a reactivation in response to intermittent glucocorticoids. To test this, we will use our newly derived mice with musclerestricted inducible Lipin1 ablation after natural aging. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the extent to which bioenergetics rescue sarcopenia in aging through amino acid biosynthesis. We hypothesize that mitochondrial reactivation fuels amino acid biogenesis, supporting protein synthesis during muscle aging. We will test this by tracing glucose-derived carbons into amino acids in oxidative versus glycolytic myofibers. We will also test the extent to which muscle PGC1a mediates these effects in young versus aging muscle.

Two different yet related observations may provide an opportunity to improve the outlook of ovarian cancer patients. Both involve DNA damage and repair. 1) The most effective and widely used drugs, the platinum compounds (cisplatin and carboplatin), lose their effectiveness over time - drug resistance develops. An important (but not the only) reason for drug resistance is an acquired ability of ovarian cancers to repair the damage caused by cisplatin DNA adducts. 2) A different class of drugs that induce DNA damage, the PARP inhibitors, has recently been approved by the FDA for patients with DNA repair defects, such as germline or acquired mutations in BRACA1/2. Unfortunately, patients with defects in DNA repair genes represent only a small fraction of ovarian cancer patients. We propose that targeting the mitochondrial protein sideroflexin 4 (sideroflexin 4) may provide a path to addressing both these problems. We discovered that reducing the levels of sideroflexin 4 disrupted Fe-S cluster formation in the mitochondria and cytosol of ovarian cancer cells. We propose that the loss of Fe-S clusters will have major cellular consequences affecting ovarian cancer. First, reduction of Fe-S proteins will increase oxidative stress and DNA damage via the acquisition and redistribution of cellular iron. Second, because critical enzymes involved in NER (nucleotide excision repair) and HRR (homologous recombination repair) require Fe-S clusters for their function and stability, targeting sideroflexin 4 will reduce the activity of DNA these repair pathways. Given the possibility that reduction of sideroflexin 4 could both induce DNA damage and inhibit DNA repair, we further hypothesize that disruption of sideroflexin 4 might enhance the efficacy of platinum-based compounds and expand the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors to ovarian cancers without defects in DNA repair: i.e., render these cancers exquisitely sensitive, like BRCA-mutant cells, to platinum-based drugs and PARP inhibitors. In pilot experiments, we indeed observed that inhibiting sideroflexin 4 1) inhibited DNA repair proteins; 2) enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin; 3) sensitized ovarian cancer cells to PARP inhibitors. We propose three Specific Aims to study the effects of sideroflexin 4 in ovarian cancer. In Aim 1, we explore how and to what extent reduction of sideroflexin 4 increases oxidative stress, limits DNA repair and enhances DNA damage. In Aim 2, we examine the role of targeting sideroflexin 4 in enhancing the effectiveness of both platinumbased compounds and PARP inhibitors in cell cultures and mouse models. In Aim 3 we determine the precise molecular site and mechanism by which sideroflexin 4 functions in Fe-S cluster biogenesis, and directly link this effect to the reduction of DNA repair proteins in NER and HRR pathways. Impact: targeting sideroflexin 4 may represent an opportunity to enhance the efficacy of platinum-based drugs and extend the use of PARP inhibitors to the majority of ovarian cancer patients with normal DNA repair function.",5,5R01CA233636-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,10,10,2,4

Abstract One out of six people with HIV (people with HIV) in the U.S. are incarcerated annually; two-thirds of incarcerated persons meet criteria for substance use disorder (substance use disorder) and many more in carceral settings are at risk for HIV. Ending the U.S. HIV epidemic hinges on linking and engaging criminal legal system-involved people with and at risk for HIV, especially those with substance use disorders, to optimize ART and PrEP uptake and adherence. Carceral facilities can offer ART and PrEP access, and increasingly substance use disorder treatment, but in the year following release, nearly 80% of people with HIV lack viral suppression, and PrEP coverage is extremely limited. Post-release disruptions in ART stem from multiple causes: health system complexity, substance use disorder relapse, unstable housing, medical mistrust, and stigma. PrEP outcomes are underexplored, but preliminary data suggest similar challenges. Because HIV transmission risk is high upon community re-entry, multimodal interventions among recently incarcerated people with and at risk for HIV are critical to ending the HIV epidemic.

Our knowledge of recurrent genetic Acute myeloid leukemia-associated features, survival associations, subsequent genetic risk classification and clinical practice is informed by largescale genomic studies performed over the past decade on patients of Central-European ancestry. Thus, current clinical practice is predicated on the supposition that adequate testing has been performed, and that genetic background should not affect the known Acute myeloid leukemia-associated genetic and genomic landscape and genes that associate with treatment response and/or that drive Acute myeloid leukemia-genesis. However, our published and preliminary data reveal that ancestry affects not only the frequencies and impact of known Acute myeloid leukemia-associated gene mutations, but also multiple recurrent variants in genes thus-far not implicated in Acute myeloid leukemia-genesis. We hypothesize that: a) known Acute myeloid leukemia-associated drivers may carry different prognostic significance and might need to be adjusted in clinical risk classifications depending on ancestry, and b) some unrecognized molecular features are ancestry-associated drivers of Acute myeloid leukemia-genesis and/or therapy resistance. We propose to extend our initial studies of Acute myeloid leukemia genomes and genomics to provide statistical confidence around frequently mutated genes, and a more inclusive molecularly-adjusted risk and treatment stratification for Acute myeloid leukemia patients. Next, we will focus on NPM1c, a genotype which confers favorable outcome in Acute myeloid leukemia patients with Central-European ancestry, but poor outcomes in other ancestries. We will use cutting-edge single-cell multiomic assays to delineate bystander clonal mutations from potential driver mutations, then we will biologically test their role in clonality/leukemia-stem-cell frequency and treatment response. We expect to provide an inclusive characterization of the genetic and genomic landscape of Acute myeloid leukemia, identify those variants with prognostic significance, and provide exemplars of here-to-fore unrecognized drivers of treatment response and survival. The overall goal is to enable precision oncology approaches which accommodate the effects of underlying human genetics.",5,5R01CA284595-02,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,16,0,4,4

Project Summary / Abstract The ongoing monkeypox (monkeypox) outbreak, with a total of more than 87,000 cases reported in over 100 nonendemic countries, highlights the pandemic potential of poxviruses. Due to its zoonotic nature with broad hosts and unidentified natural reservoirs of the causative agent, monkeypox virus (mpox virus), future spillovers and outbreaks are expected even if the current outbreak is contained. Although typically manifesting in milder symptoms than smallpox, mpox virus infections can still cause significant morbidity and mortality (up to 10% for clade I) that need to be therapeutically mitigated. The clinical efficacy of FDA-approved smallpox antiviral drugs is unclear or unpromising for treating mpox virus, necessitating dedicated and expanded efforts in developing mpox virus antivirals. The goal of this grant application is to develop novel antivirals for treating mpox virus. Prior research from our team has developed and validated an efficient and robust reporter assay using the vaccinia virus (vaccinia virus), and identified and characterized three high quality and chemically distinct antiviral hits with strong potencies (EC50 = 0.14‒2.1 M; plaque reduction at 10 M 1,400‒160,000-fold), no cytotoxicity (CC50 > 250 M) and largely favorable ADME properties. The immediate focus of this grant is to further develop these three hit series into pre-clinical candidates using a highly integrated, multi-disciplinary approach combining medicinal chemistry, virology, ADME / pharmacokinetic (pharmacokinetic), toxicity, animal efficacy and proteomics. Three Specific Aims are proposed: 1) optimization and expansion of the identified hits. Iterative structure-activity relationship (structure-activity relationship) and structure-property relationship (structure-property relationship) studies will be carried out via extensive analog synthesis, antiviral assay and ADME profiling to obtain optimized leads. Hit expansion will also be conducted by screening the high quality synthetic compounds in PI's lab as well as preselected commercial compounds; Aim 2) in vivo pharmacokinetic, toxicity and efficacy studies, where the acute and sub-acute toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies in mice will guide compound selection for efficacy studies in mice; Aim 3) determine the antiviral mechanism of action (mechanism of action). The molecular targets and antiviral mechanism of action of optimized leads will be determined using a few different methods: a) identify the viral replication stage(s) targeted by the leads; b) select resistant mutants by passaging virus in cultured cells in the presence of individual lead compound, and sequence viral genomes to identify affected genes; The compound will then be tested in recombinant viruses harboring the selected mutations; c) design and synthesize chemical probes to label, pull down, and identify the target protein(s); d) test metal chelating analogs in resolvase biochemical assays. Overall, 2-3 antiviral leads with strong potency, favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, minimal toxicities, and established mechanism of action will be developed, setting the stage for further pre-clinical development of mpox virus drugs that will also contribute substantially to countering other orthopoxviruses.",1,1R01AI183580-01,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

Project Summary This goal of this project is to investigate neuroinflammation in Parkinson disease (Parkinson disease) using positron emission tomography (positron emission tomography) with a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1) specifintracarotid radiotracer [11C]CS1P1. Neuroinflammation is a key element in the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinson disease, thus quantitative measures of neuroinflammation provide key evidence for pathogenesis, identifintracarotidation of therapeutintracarotid targets and quantifintracarotidation of target engagement in Parkinson disease. sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 is the most abundant receptor in the S1P receptor 5 member family. In the central nervous system (central nervous system), sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 is expressed in neurons and glial cells, including astrocytes, mintracarotidroglia, and oligodendrocytes. Dysregulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 signaling plays a critintracarotidal pathophysiologintracarotidal role in inflammatory diseases in the central nervous system. We reported that [11C]CS1P1, previously called [11C]TZ3321, specifintracarotidally targets sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 receptors with increased uptake at sites of inflammation in three animal models of inflammatory disease. We had received FDA approval of [11C]CS1P1 for human use (IND#:146548) and completed whole body dosimetry positron emission tomography scans for 5 male and 5 female normal healthy partintracarotidipants, and brain positron emission tomography scans in 10 MS patients; our results demonstrated that [11C]CS1P1 positron emission tomography is able to detect neuroinflammation in MS. Macaques with a unilateral nigrostriatal brain injury, caused by intracarotid (intracarotid) infusion of the neurotoxin MPTP, were used to directly compare brain uptake of [11C]CS1P1 with the widely used neuroinflammation tracer [11C]PBR28. Four macaques were scanned with each tracer under baseline conditions and following unilateral injury. Surprisingly, 6-8 weeks after MPTP-induced injury, both radiotracers had increased cortintracarotidal brain uptake demonstrating a robust neuroinflammatory response that highly correlated with each other (r2 = 0.7-0.8). However, when compared with baseline imaging, the post-MPTP increase in ipsilateral frontal cortex compared to contralateral cortex for [11C]CS1P1 (89%) signifintracarotidantly exceeded that for [11C]PBR28 (12%). Therefore, we propose to validate the positron emission tomography measures and systematintracarotidally evaluate the ability of [11C]CS1P1 to quantitatively measure neuroinflammation after MPTP-induced injury in macaques. We hypothesize that positron emission tomography with the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 radiotracer [11C]CS1P1 can quantify neuroinflammation in humans with Parkinson disease. To test our hypothesis, we propose two specifintracarotid aims. Aim-1# is to investigate regional sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 expression in the brain of MPTP-treated NHPs by longitudinal positron emission tomography imaging and terminal post-positron emission tomography autoradiography, immunohistochemintracarotidal (immunohistochemical) staining, immunofluorescence (immunofluorescence) analysis, and ELISA studies of the brain tissues. Aim-2# is to investigate sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 expression in the brains of Parkinson disease patients and healthy controls through positron emission tomography imaging as well as in vitro studies of banked postmortem tissue from Parkinson disease cases and controls, including autoradiography, immunohistochemical staining, immunofluorescence analysis and ELISA studies. We expect to demonstrate that positron emission tomography with [11C]S1P1 radiotracer can quantify neuroinflammation in Parkinson disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.",1,1R01NS134586-01,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,2,6,6,1

Project Summary/Abstract Ovarian cancer is the second most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in women around the world. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (High-grade serous ovarian cancer) accounts for more than 70% of all ovarian cancer deaths. Approximately 50% of High-grade serous ovarian cancers harbor alterations in the genes involved in homologous recombination (homologous recombination) DNA repair pathway. These tumors tend to respond well to PARP inhibitors and chemotherapy. CCNE1 (Cyclin E1) gene amplification and overexpression is frequently found in homologous recombination-proficient ovarian cancer and is associated with primary chemoresistance and poor clinical outcomes. CCNE1 gene amplification is present in 15-20% ovarian tumors, and overexpression of Cyclin E1 is detected in over 40% of ovarian cancer specimens. Currently, there are no effective treatment approaches for this type of High-grade serous ovarian cancer. By using Cyclin E1-overexpressing syngeneic and humanized ovarian patient-derived xenograft (patient-derived xenograft) models of High-grade serous ovarian cancer, we will identify novel therapies for the treatment of High-grade serous ovarian cancer cancers with amplification or high expression of Cyclin E1. Our preliminary data suggests that Cyclin E1 downregulates IRF1 and type I interferon (interferon) expression in a CDK2 kinase-independent manner in ovarian cancer cells. Our preliminary data also reveal that overexpression of Cyclin E1 in ovarian cancer cells promotes pro-tumor polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (tumor-associated macrophages) in the tumor microenvironment (tumor microenvironment). Expression of IRF1 and type I interferons has been implicated in pro-tumor polarization of tumor-associated macrophages in cancers. We plan to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of Cyclin E1 on the type I interferon signaling pathway and tumor-associated macrophages in Cyclin E1-amplified/overexpressing High-grade serous ovarian cancer tumors and to develop therapeutic approaches for this type of ovarian cancer. We hypothesize that downregulation of IRF1 and type I interferons by Cyclin E1 in tumor cells fosters an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in High-grade serous ovarian cancer with Cyclin E1amplification/overexpression by promoting pro-tumor macrophage polarization. We also hypothesize that targeting the conventional tumor cell-intrinsic oncogenic function of Cyclin E1 with CDK2i (CDK2 inhibitors) or Ataxia telangiectasia, and Rad3-related inhibitors (Ataxia telangiectasia, and Rad3-related inhibitors), in combination with remodeling the pro-tumor tumor-associated macrophages that induced by expression of Cyclin E1 in the tumor microenvironment with immunomodulators, such as STING agonists, will provide promising therapeutics for ovarian cancer patients with Cyclin E1-amplification/overexpression. In Aim 1, we will determine how cyclin E1 regulates IRF1 and type I interferons in both human and mouse ovarian cancer cell lines. In Aim 2, we will determine how the Cyclin E1-regulated type I interferon signaling pathway promotes pro-tumor polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment of High-grade serous ovarian cancer tumors with Cyclin E1amplification/overexpression both in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 3, based on our recent findings that STING agonism activates type I interferon signaling pathway and repolarizes pro-tumor macrophages to an anti-tumor status, we will assess the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of STING agonists in combination with CDK2i or Ataxia telangiectasia, and Rad3-related inhibitors, in both syngeneic mouse models and humanized patient-derived xenograft models.",1,1R37CA279440-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this renewal R01 application is to identify an 18F-labeled radiotracer to quantitatively measure sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1) expression in multiple sclerosis (multiple sclerosis) patients. multiple sclerosis is associated with a lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune response that ultimately leads to repeating cycles of demyelination and repair. sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 is extensively expressed on lymphocytes and endothelial cells and participates in this autoimmune inflammatory process by regulating immune cell trafficking in the brain. Currently, four S1P modulators fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, and ponesimod have been approved by FDA for treating multiple sclerosis, but the pathophysiologic mechanism of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 in multiple sclerosis is still not well understood. Positron emission tomography (Positron emission tomography) investigating sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 function in multiple sclerosis and other diseases is limited by the lack of a clinically suitable radiotracer. To address this urgent clinical need, our team successfully transferred [11C]CS1P1, a C-11 sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 radiotracer into clinical investigation. Our human study data confirm that liver is the critical organ for radiation dose absorption and that [11C]CS1P1 is safe for patient who receives a dose of up to 740 MBq (20 mCi). Our proof of concept brain studies showed higher uptake of [11C]CS1P1 in gray matter than in white matter, consistent with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 mRNA expression in the normal human brain. In multiple sclerosis patients, we observed increased [11C]CS1P1 uptake within both brain lesions and normal appearing white matter (white matter). These results are consistent with extant evidence of inflammatory infiltrate in both the brain lesions and normal appearing white matter in multiple sclerosis. Together, our data suggest that Positron emission tomography measurement of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 protein expression could provide a unique method to detect neuroinflammation and response in multiple sclerosis patients. Our initial radiometabolite analysis of human plasma discovered a lipophilic radiometabolite post injection of [11C]CS1P1 and led to initial concerns. However, we recently confirmed the molecular structure of the radiometabolite, and radiometabolite analysis of the rat brain and plasma post-injection of the radiotracer and Positron emission tomography brain studies of the F-18 labeled radiometaobolite demonstrated the radiometabolite does not enter into the brain. Additionally, our team has synthesized ~120 new structurally diverse sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 ligands, and ~30 of them are highly potent (IC50 < 20 nM) and selective for sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1. To date, our preliminary data indicate that three F-18 radiotracers are promise for sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 imaging, two of them are F-18 labeled using different procedures and are anticipated to have different pathway compared to [11C]CS1P1. Therefore, in this renewal phase, we will leverage our recent experience with [11C]CS1P1 and develop and transfer an 18F-labeled sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 tracer for clinical investigation. We propose two specific aims: 1) Identify and transfer the most promising 18F-labeled sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 tracer into human investigations. 2) Implement Positron emission tomography imaging human studies in healthy controls and multiple sclerosis patients. When the completion of this application, a clinical suitable sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 18F-radiotracer will be identified and ready to implement for multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory diseases.",5,5R01NS103988-07,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,2,6,6,1
10830250,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/i2NamZULK0GPv-MWmpKu2Q/project-details/10830250#similar-Projects,ECM biomaterials for diabetic foot ulcers,"A. SPECIFIC AIMS: Diabetes is widespread in the United States, and its complications have devastating effects on health and quality of life. Impaired wound healing is a serious complication that leads to the development of chronic wounds in the lower extremities. Patients with such wounds display decreased mobility, and overall health, and are the most frequently subjected to limb amputation. Five year mortality following major amputation is over 80%. Wound care practices can be effective, but a large fraction of diabetic ulcers still persist or lead to amputation. Novel therapeutic strategies must focus on the pathological mechanisms underlying impaired healing in order to improve patient outcomes. Wounds become chronic due to diabetic hyperglycemia, including reduced blood flow, hypoxia, and aberrant behavior of immune cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes that are critical to healing. Recent unbiased analyses, such as single RNA seq, have revealed the critical involvement of fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (extracellular matrix) production. Surprisingly, little attention has been paid to the role of extracellular matrix proteins as negative modulators of healing. Work in our laboratory suggests the contribution of the matricellular protein thrombospondin-2 (thrombospondin-2) to diabetic wounds. Normally, thrombospondin-2 is expressed in wounds and contributes to extracellular matrix remodeling and vascular regression, in part, by increasing and decreasing the levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 and lysyl oxidase (lysyl oxidase) and extracellular matrix crosslinking, respectively. Our recent work has shown that thrombospondin-2 is elevated in the wounds of diabetic patients and mice suggesting a correlation between compromised wound healing and high thrombospondin-2 expression. These findings allowed us to put forward the overarching premise that abnormal extracellular matrix production and assembly contribute to prevention of wound closure. We obtained partial confirmation for this hypothesis by generating diabetic mice lacking TSP2 (dbdb-DKO mice) and observed normalization of healing. In this application, we propose studies to explore and exploit extracellular matrix phenotypes in diabetes. Specifically, we plan to characterize extracellular matrix abnormalities and their contribution to cell dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the newly generated dbdb-DKO mouse will be used to probe a novel extracellular matrix phenotype. We also aim to translate our findings into a bioengineering approach that will provide proof-of-principle for the utilization of novel extracellular matrixs as part of a combinatorial therapeutic strategy. These studies will include extracellular matrix obtained from a TSP2 KO pig that we have created for the provision of clinical grade materials. Accordingly, the specific aims of this application are: Specific Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that fibroblast dysfunction and altered extracellular matrix production and assembly in diabetes contribute to delayed wound closure. We will perform wound healing in these mice and monitor recovery of biomechanical integrity, a critical aspect of healing. We will also perform in vitro studies to investigate the indirect impact of diabetes on cell functions by studying the interactions of dermal fibroblasts with extracellular matrix derived from WT or dbdb mice. Specifically, we will evaluate migration, production of traction forces, and contraction. Inclusion of cell-derived extracellular matrix and cells from dbdb-DKO mice will allow us to probe the role of TSP2 in greater detail. In order to obtain a broader understanding of the signaling pathways involved in the diabetes-induced fibroblast dysfunction we will perform bulk RNA-sequencing and pathway analysis of all genotypes. Specific Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that novel engineered native constructs can restore healing in diabetic animals. We have previously shown that decellularized skin constructs and skin-derived hydrogels from TSP2 KO mice can increase cellular integration, vessel maturation, and healing in diabetic mice. In this aim, we will combine such constructs with drug delivery approaches to develop combinatorial strategies. These studies will be complemented by skin-derived extracellular matrix derived from our newly created TSP2 KO pigs. Specifically, we will prepare drug-loaded TSP2-null constructs embedded with alginate microspheres to combat infections, reduce chronic inflammation and restore healing. Full thickness excisional wounds will be made and the rate of healing will be quantified through daily measurements of wound area. Additionally, wounds will be subjected to histological and immunohistochemical stains in order to assess wound closure, epithelialization, inflammation, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Completion of this project should allow us to establish a major molecular mechanism in impaired wound healing, which could inform the development of engineering solutions to non-healing wounds. In exciting parallel studies, we have generated a TSP2 KO pig, which we anticipate will be used to produce extracellular matrix-based products for clinical use. We believe the proposed rigorous studies in this application will provide significant support for the advancement of regenerative extracellular matrix constructs towards the clinic.",5,5R01DK132645-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,15,2,0,0
10880966,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/P82xdAXaYEedY5EyxpAu4A/project-details/10880966#similar-Projects,Molecular Magnetic Resonance of Hepatic Fibrogenesis,"A. Specific Aims Identification of high-risk populations suitable for screening and chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatocellular carcinoma) has been proposed as an effective and efficient strategy to impact hepatocellular carcinoma-related mortality. Screening and earlier detection of hepatocellular carcinoma has had some impact on hepatocellular carcinoma mortality. However, the absence of tools to accurately predict which patients will progress to hepatocellular carcinoma remains a significant barrier to development of effective chemoprevention agents. Progress in prediction of who will progress to hepatocellular carcinoma and whether chemoprevention is likely to be effective would have a major clinical impact. Liver fibrosis is a common pathway shared by all progressive chronic liver diseases that raise risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, regardless of the underlying etiologies. Many lines of evidence suggest that increased fibrosis and fibrogenesis are independent predictors of hepatocellular carcinoma transformation, and that reducing liver fibrosis reduces hepatocellular carcinoma risk. Our lab has developed molecular probes for noninvasive, quantitative imaging of liver fibrosis and fibrogenesis throughout the entire liver. With a type I collagen targeted peptide-based MR probe we showed that we could accurately stage liver fibrosis in 6 different rodent models. We developed a second type of probe in prior work funded by this grant: molecular MR probes that target the aldehyde-containing allysine residue on oxidized collagen and showed that we could specifically quantify fibrogenesis (fibrotic disease activity). In this Renewal, we propose to expand this toolbox further and develop a third novel probe that targets inflammation associated with fibrogenesis (inflammation associated with fibrogenesis). This probe is based on the low relaxivity Fe2+-PyC3A chelate which is activated by rapid oxidation to high relaxivity Fe3+-PyC3A in the presence of peroxidases released during inflammation and which then binds to allysine residues that are present during fibrogenesis, retaining the probe and its high relaxivity signal at the site of inflammation associated with fibrogenesis. We will deploy these three probes (fibrosis, fibrogenesis, inflammation associated with fibrogenesis) to characterize the combinations of these biochemical features that best predict transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma in rat and mouse models. Next, we will use molecular MR for real-time monitoring of response to chemoprevention agents that have been proven effective in preclinical models, and to guide effective dosing. The overarching goal of this project is to leverage molecular imaging of fibrosis to accurately predict risk of progression to hepatocellular carcinoma, and real-time monitoring of efficacy of interventions that reduce the risk. Aim 1. Develop a turn-on molecular probe to detect fibrogenesis when it is associated with inflammation. 1.1. Synthesize a small focused library of allysine-targeted, Fe2+-PyC3A probes 1.2. Screen the probes for relaxivity in the presence/absence of peroxidase, target affinity, non-specific binding, and allysine binding kinetics to a model proteiny 1.3. Confirm the ability of the inflammation associated with fibrogenesis probe to detect inflammation associated fibrogenesis in a mouse model of NASH/fibrosis/hepatocellular carcinoma (choline-deficient, l-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet and a single dose diethylnitrosamine (diethylnitrosamine) injection; diethylnitrosamine-CDAHFD) 1.4. Demonstrate the specificity of the inflammation associated with fibrogenesis probe for inflammation with fibrogenesis compared to fibrosis with minimal inflammation in rat diethylnitrosamine (diethylnitrosamine) models of acute inflammation. Aim 2. Define which combination of total liver collagen, liver fibrogenesis, and inflammation associated with fibrogenesis assessed early in the course of disease by molecular MRI is predictive of worse disease progression 2.1. Image diethylnitrosamine-CDAHFD mice with moderate or severe liver fibrosis using CM-101 (collagen targeted probe), Gd-1,4 (fibrogenesis probe), and the AIF probe from Aim 1 and then follow these animals and determine which animals develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Compare the accuracy of the three molecular MR methods performed early in the course of disease to predict worse disease progression and to predict hepatocellular carcinoma transformation. Aim 3. Demonstrate that molecular MR can provide an accurate assessment of efficacy of antifibrotic therapy and that molecular MR can predict the outcome of a chemoprevention intervention. 3.1. Image diethylnitrosamine rats with Gd-1,4 and the inflammation associated with fibrogenesis probe two weeks after initiating erlotinib or vehicle treatment and compare the early molecular MR readouts with the amount of liver fibrosis at the end of treatment determined by CM-101 MR imaging, biochemical analysis, and histopathology. 3.2. Perform a dose response study with erlotinib in diethylnitrosamine rats and perform molecular MR two weeks after initiating treatment and then follow animals to measure hepatocellular carcinoma transformation histologically. We expect that disease activity at two weeks assessed by molecular MR will predict treatment efficacy and the minimally effective dose of erlotinib.",2,2R01DK121789-05,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,12,2,0,0
10814395,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/fjO_sIRf5kS7LfKljlx5OQ/project-details/10814395#similar-Projects,Engineering T cells to Promote Islet Transplant,"A. Specific Aims Type 1 diabetes (Type 1 diabetes) is a progressive autoimmune disease which renders individuals incapable of regulating their blood glucose levels due to immune-mediated β cell destruction, resulting in loss of insulin production and many severe health complications that, if untreated, lead to death. Careful monitoring of blood glucose coupled with insulin injections have made Type 1 diabetes a chronic disease in which Type 1 diabetes individuals live ~ a decade less than their healthy counterparts. Thus, a cure for Type 1 diabetes is highly desirable. Cell gene therapy has proven to be an effective way to treat recalcitrant diseases such as pediatric leukemia, where chimeric antigen receptor (chimeric antigen receptor) expressing T cells achieve 90% complete response, putting many individuals into very long remissions1, but to date no engineered T cell therapies have been attempted to cure Type 1 diabetes in humans. We propose to test the hypothesis that engineered T cells can enable islet transplant with minimal or no additional immunosuppression. Islet transplantation represents the best-case scenario to test the ability of engineered T cells to protect islet cells from immune attack and will likely lay the foundation by which strategies are developed to treat new onset Type 1 diabetes. In islet transplant, MHC matching of donor and recipient rarely occurs, generating highly expressed, unique islet-specific HLA antigens that can be targeted by chimeric antigen receptor engineered T regulatory cells (chimeric antigen receptor Tregs) or T cells engineered to express molecules that suppress the immune system (T suppressor cells or Suppressor Cells). Additionally, through a comprehensive screening process, we have identified two targets, fibroblast activation protein (fibroblast activation protein) and dipeptidyl peptidase like 6 (dipeptidyl peptidase like 6), that are highly expressed on α and β cells and have limited expression elsewhere that could be used to treat recently diagnosed individuals, and all transplant recipients without the desired MHC mismatch. In this proposal, we will further develop this toolbox to both develop better in vivo, preclinical models of Type 1 diabetes and new cell and gene therapies that will prevent, stall or reverse Type 1 diabetes. Within the last decade, rapid progress made in T cell-based therapies makes it possible to consider such therapies for Type 1 diabetes. Following long-term remission of 3 cancer patients treated by CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptors developed by the Center for Cellular Immunotherapies at Penn under the leadership of Carl June2, the chimeric antigen receptor T cell revolution was launched. This early success drove considerable investment, empowering many institutions and companies to develop ways to improve both the safety and efficacy of, and reduce cost to produce engineered T cells. Many of these innovations will also help enable cell and gene therapies for Type 1 diabetes, which is the overarching goal of this RFA. The ultimate goal of this application is to successfully treat three nonhuman primates (nonhuman primates) with engineered T cells after an islet transplant, which we predict will launch similar enthusiasm for Type 1 diabetes cell and gene therapy as the first three CD19-chimeric antigen receptor recipients did for cancer chimeric antigen receptor therapy. To achieve this goal, an experienced team of investigators with complementary expertise will lead this proposal. This team, a transplant surgeon who helped pioneer islet transplantation as a Type 1 diabetes therapy (Naji), a veterinary physician with expertise developing nonhuman primates T regulatory cell therapy models (Duran-Struuck), and a cell and gene therapist with a track record of engineering T cells and developing first-in-human clinical trials (Riley), have been working closely together via Helmsley Foundation funding to obtain the preliminary data presented in this application. This team is now is poised to immediately perform in vivo studies to test the ability of engineered T cell therapies to prevent, stall, or reverse Type 1 diabetes. Aim 1. Engineer T Suppressor Cells (Suppressor Cells) to Facilitate Islet Transplant in Humanized Mouse Models. While T regulatory cells are potent immune suppressors, there are other promising ways to induce tolerance that may work as stand-alone therapies or synergize with chimeric antigen receptor Tregs to protect β cell function. We will explore using PD-L1, TGF-β1, and/or γ-aminobutiric acid (GABA) expressing cells targeted to the islet to mediate islet acceptance alone or in combination with chimeric antigen receptor Treg approaches we developed using humanized mice. Aim 2. Optimize T cell Approaches to Promote Islet Transplant in nonhuman primatess. To date our efforts have focused on developing nonhuman primates chimeric antigen receptor Tregs to enable islet transplant. We have optimized isolation, transduction, and expansion of nonhuman primates MHC-specific chimeric antigen receptor T regulatory cells and are poised to start islet transplant experiments immediately. After we perform proof of principle experiments using chimeric antigen receptor Tregs, we will prioritize future experiments based on the data obtained in Aim 1. A particularly exciting aspect of our studies is testing whether the ortho-IL-2 system developed by the Garcia Lab3 can work in non-human primates and support engineered Treg or other engineered T cell function and expansion while having no effect on endogenous effector cells. If successful, these studies will form the basis and rationale for Phase I clinical trials in humans.",5,5R01DK132725-03,RFA-DK-21-005,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,12,4,0,0
10974667,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/sokPA1qk-Eae-a0Me7dR-Q/project-details/10974667#similar-Projects,Investigating the role of helix-1 in the fibrillization of SAA1-76,"AA amyloidosis is a severe complication of chronic inflammatory disorders and is potentially fatal. The amyloid fibrils involved in AA amyloidosis are derived from serum amyloid A (serum amyloid A), which is an acute phase reactant protein. In AA amyloidosis, circulating amyloid fibrils are deposited in organs, ultimately leading to their failure. Serum amyloid A (serum amyloid A) is the major protein component of amyloid fibrils associated with AA amyloidosis. There is accruing evidence that overexpression of serum amyloid A is correlated with the severity of inflammation caused by COVID-19. These highlight the need to unravel the mechanism of serum amyloid A misfolding that could in turn facilitate the design of potential inhibitors. Molecular dynamic (Molecular dynamic) simulations have yielded an in silico model for serum amyloid A misfolding where the N-terminal helical (helix-1) region plays a pivotal role. Helix-1 is believed to transition from a -helix to -hairpin. Once formed, the -hairpin units are postulated to associate and stack upon themselves to yield fibrils. We propose to investigate the veracity of the in silico model of serum amyloid A misfolding by synthesizing and characterizing peptide mutants derived from the helix-1 region of serum amyloid A and the longer fragment, serum amyloid A1-76. The roles of specific amino acids will be probed along with the trajectory each takes during serum amyloid A misfolding. Using standard spectroscopic methods, we will determine changes in amyloidogenic propensity, conformation, key molecular interaction, and amyloid morphology of each peptide during or after serum amyloid A fibrillization. Experimental data will be correlated with the findings of the in silico results to yield information on the mechanism. The data obtained from helix-1 fragments serum amyloid A1-13 and serum amyloid A1-27 will be extended to the truncated peptide, serum amyloid A1-76, found in amyloid deposits of serum amyloid A. We intend to emply in silico and in vitro study to help yield important mechanistic clues. One of the major goals of this project is to provide students, >50% of whom are underrepresented minorities, with the opportunity to conduct research and gain experience working in a modern biomedical laboratory. Undergraduate researchers involved in the project will be expected to synthesize and spectroscopically characterize peptides, verify spectroscopic data using Molecular dynamic simulation, and characterize amyloid morphology. Each student will focus on aspects of the project that best interest them and fit their background. Regular research group meetings will ensure that students participate in the planning of experiments and analysis of data. Students will have the opportunity to apply theories learned in the classroom to real world biochemical investigation. Research experiences that are based on current technology allow students to solidify and fortify their knowledge. Hands-on experiential learning is one of the most effective approaches to develop students' critical thinking, perseverance, and confidence that could translate to a fulfilling career. Their experience will help them enter graduate programs and/or find employment in biomedical careers. The educational impact of this project also extends to local high school and community college students working in the PI's laboratory. The research experiences of these students will help ensure the vibrancy of the scientific infrastructure in the US.",1,1R15GM155857-01,PAR-21-155,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,2,6,6,1

At the same time, protein degradation must be carefully regulated. AAA+ proteases assemble into multi-subunit structures with an internal proteolytic chamber, accessible through narrow channels that exclude natively folded proteins. This mechanism protects most proteins from unintended degradation and requires specific substrates to be recognized, unfolded, and then translocated into the degradation chamber. In the AAA+ ClpXP protease, for example, a ring hexamer of ClpX uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to unfold specific target proteins and translocate them into ClpP for degradation. ClpXP is one of the best-characterized AAA+ proteases and is a paradigm for other ATPdependent proteases and AAA+ remodeling machines. These ATP-fueled enzymes perform a wide variety of mechanical remodeling, transport, and regulatory tasks in the cell. In mammals, loss of mitochondrial ClpP results in infertility, hearing loss, and growth defects, whereas mitochondrial ClpX plays an important role in heme biosynthesis. Bacterial ClpXP can promote pathogenesis and is a validated antibiotic target in M. tuberculosis. Substantial progress has been made in understanding the general biochemical and structural features of E. coli ClpXP and other AAA+ enzymes but important and fundamental questions concerning the molecular mechanisms of these machines remain. For example, it is not known how ClpX identifies many classes of N-terminal and C-terminal degrons, whether ClpX rotates with respect to ClpP during normal function, whether proofreading helps ensure degradation specificity, how multiple substrate chains can be simultaneously translocated through the ClpX channel, what the detailed and interacts with polypeptide substrates during mechanical unfolding, whether ATP hydrolysis can occur at multiple positions in the spiral ClpX ring or only at one or a few special positions, and how the detailed ATPase cycle is coupled to mechanical work. The experiments described in this proposal will address these questions and provide a conceptual framework applicable to studies of the entire superfamily of AAA+ machines.",5,5R35GM141517-04,PAR-19-367,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

However, AAV is inefficient at packaging its genome, and this leaves many empty or partially full capsids that need to be removed in manufacturing. Empty capsids can increase the immunogenicity and toxicity of the AAV, especially when high doses are required. This project will take a structural biology approach to understand how the presence of the genome in AAV affects the capsid quaternary structure and the resulting effects on capsid surface chemistry and structural integrity. This will provide better methods to remove empty capsids or reduce the production of empty capsids, thus providing a safer AAV product for patients. Molecular changes induced by AAV genome packaging will be determined and integrated with changes in viral conformational dynamics and physicochemical properties. This novel integration of single particle force measurements using an atomic force microscopy (atomic force microscopy) with surface residue charge distributions from amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDXmass spectrometry) and native mass spectrometry (mass spectrometry) will lead to insight into genome interaction with AAV capsids and how the presence of the genome changes the capsid structure, chemistry, and integrity. An unprecedented view into how the structure of a viral capsid reacts to different manufacturing conditions and cellular trafficking conditions that occur during AAV production will be developed by completing the following aims: Aim 1: Ascertain the difference in the charge and hydrophobicity of AAV capsids. AAV2 and AAV8 will be used as model systems with three different genome sizes. Chemical force microscopy (Chemical force microscopy) a specialized atomic force microscopy technique, will measure the changes in charge and hydrophobicity of AAV capsids under relevant manufacturing and cellular trafficking conditions. Aim 2: Identify the contributions of capsid protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions on AAV viral particle dynamics. Comparison of empty, partially full, and full AAV will reveal contributions of DNA on intrinsic dynamics using HDXmass spectrometry and native mass spectrometry. Further, these measurements will also map interaction interfaces of AAV capsid with encapsulated DNA in full and partially full AAV. Aim 3: Determine the physical rigidity and brittleness difference between AAV capsids. Nanoindentation, an atomic force microscopy technique, will be used to determine the effects of DNA on AAV capsid strength. Upon completion of this work, a data driven hypothesis on how AAV interacts with its genome and how the capsid structure changes with different genome sizes will be developed. The effect of solution conditions, which vary greatly during the virus life cycle and manufacturing cycle, will be elucidated. Descriptions of DNA packaging in AAV and the structural changes that occur due to DNA packaging will be completed. This information will improve production, quality control, and safety of AAV and bring more lifesaving AAV therapies to market.",5,5R21AI175913-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,3,11,2,0

It is often believed that there is a straightforward path to the clinic once gene replacement efficacy is shown in preclinical models. However, major obstacles limit safe and effective gene therapy for many diseases, particularly in systemically delivered contexts. Some diseases are not yet tractable because therapeutic gene expression in one tissue might be toxic in another, or because the therapeutic window of cargo expression is too narrow to safely administer. Toxicity in liver and dorsal root ganglia have been observed in several gene therapies, regardless of capsid or cargo. More versatile, fined-tuned, and self-regulated gene expression cassettes are required for safer and more effective gene therapies. Many approaches exist to regulate gene therapy cargoes, including synthetic promoters and tissue-specific microRNA binding sites. However, despite the ubiquity of RNA processing in the genome, few efforts have incorporated alternative splicing into gene therapies. In Aim 1, we will leverage tissuespecific splicing patterns to generate cargoes facilitating expression in certain tissues but not others. In a first example, we will use develop methods to restrict cargo expression to skeletal muscle and de-target the heart. We have already incorporated muscle-specific exons not expressed in heart into AAV and tested their activity in vivo; we will further optimize these cassettes by testing hundreds of splice site and cis-element motif variations. In a second example, we will identify and test exons that de-target liver and dorsal root ganglion but preserve expression in muscle, heart and/or central nervous system tissues. We will individually validate ""winner"" cassettes for both examples. We term this approach Tissue-specific Alternative splicing to Restrict Globally Expressed Therapeutic-AAV (TARGET-AAV). In Aim 2, we will re-purpose naturally occurring auto-regulatory cassettes to design and test gene therapies that can sense and regulate their own expression levels. We will use RNA binding proteins mutated in motor neuron disease as test cases, given that RNA binding proteins are well established to regulate their own expression. We will incorporate intronic miRNAs knocking down the corresponding endogenous proteins in the same cassette as an auto-regulated, healthy version of the same RNA binding protein. Similar to Aim 1, we will optimize auto-regulatory behavior by making alterations to intronic and exonic sequences. We will establish proof-of-concept for this approach in cell culture and in iPSC-based models of these disease. We call this approach Biologically Regulated Interchangeable Tuneable Elements (Biologically Regulated Interchangeable Tuneable Elements). Completion of this work will provide guiding principles for the field of gene therapy to incorporate alternative splicing into gene therapy cargoes.",1,1R01NS132538-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,11,10,2,0

They are released into the extracellular space but attack targets within the host cytosol. Entry into the cytosol only occurs after toxin (CT endocytosis from the plasma membrane of the target cell. Some AB toxin (CTs, including pertussis toxin (CT (pertussis toxin (CT) and cholera toxin (CT (cholera toxin (CT), travel to the endoplasmic reticulum (endoplasmic reticulum) before toxin (CT disassembly and A chain passage into the cytosol. We have shown the dissociated A chain spontaneously unfolds at 37°C, which triggers its export to the cytosol through the mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (endoplasmic reticulumAD). Most endoplasmic reticulumAD substrates are extracted to the cytosol through the action of the AAA ATPase p97, but we have shown that the catalytic subunits of pertussis toxin (CT (pertussis toxin (CTS1) and cholera toxin (CT (cholera toxin (CTA1) instead require the cytosolic chaperone Hsp90 for passage into the cytosol. Hsp90 was not thought to recognize any specific feature of an unfolded protein, but we identified an RPP binding motif for Hsp90 at the N-terminus of pertussis toxin (CTS1 and cholera toxin (CTA1. Recent studies have documented a functional role for Grp94, the endoplasmic reticulum-localized Hsp90 family member, in pertussis toxin (CTS1 translocation and pertussis toxin (CT intoxication. Preliminary evidence further suggests the tight association between Grp94 and pertussis toxin (CTS1 is disrupted by cyclophilin B (cyclophilin B), an endoplasmic reticulum-localized peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase). Our resulting model for endoplasmic reticulumAD-mediated toxin (CT translocation proposes that pertussis toxin (CTS1 proline residues drive toxin (CT-chaperone interactions on both sides of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This novel concept will be examined using either loss-of-function studies in cell culture or in vitro studies on toxin (CT structure, toxin (CT-chaperone binding, and toxin (CT translocation from endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomes. We predict cyclophilin B and its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity will be required for the release of Grp94 from pertussis toxin (CTS1, pertussis toxin (CTS1 export to the cytosol, and pertussis toxin (CT intoxication. Both Grp94 and Hsp90 will be required for pertussis toxin (CTS1 translocation and pertussis toxin (CT intoxication. These two chaperones will recognize distinct proline-containing regions of pertussis toxin (CTS1, and loss of either binding site will trap pertussis toxin (CTS1 in the endoplasmic reticulum. Grp94 will prevent the thermal unfolding of pertussis toxin (CTS1 but will not refold the toxin (CT at 37°C, whereas Hsp90 will refold disordered pertussis toxin (CTS1 in an ATP-dependent manner that is sufficient for toxin (CT extraction to the cytosol. This work could establish the importance of proline residues for toxin (CT translocation by documenting a role for cyclophilin B in pertussis toxin (CTS1 export, a functional link between cyclophilin B and Grp94 in the processing of pertussis toxin (CTS1, and how pertussis toxin (CTS1 translocation involves the distinct functions of Hsp90 family members at both sides of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Cyclophilin and Hsp90 family members can be found in a complex and frequently act on the same substrates, but these coordinated functions have not yet been documented for endoplasmic reticulumAD-mediated toxin (CT translocation. Both protein families represent promising pharmacological targets for treating whooping cough through the inactivation of pertussis toxin (CT. A deeper understanding of pertussis toxin (CTS1-chaperone interactions could thus lead to more precise and effective therapeutics against the specific proteins required for pertussis toxin (CTS1 translocation.",5,5R21AI172773-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

Current treatment requires 4 to 6 weeks of IV antibiotic administration and multiple surgeries to remove the infected implants and surrounding tissue and restore the device, resulting in a large economic burden and significant patient morbidity. orthopaedic device-related infections are extremely recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment as these are biofilm infections, in which the bacterial pathogens are attached to surfaces surrounded by a self-produced matrix. A hallmark of biofilms is their resistance to antibiotics and the host immune system. Furthermore, antibiotics administered orally or parenterally (intravenously or through intramuscular injection) have poor bone penetration. Another treatment complication is the rise in orthopaedic device-related infections due to antibioticand multidrug-resistant (multidrug-resistant) bacteria. Local delivery of antibiotics by their incorporation into polymethylmethacrylate (polymethylmethacrylate) beads has improved treatment. We developed and tested a local antibiotic delivery system of biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) microspheres that retain the advantages of polymethylmethacrylate antibiotic delivery, but do not require removal. An emerging strategy to treat multidrug-resistant infections is to directly target and lyse the bacterial pathogen using IV administration of bacteriophage (viruses that kill bacteria) or `phage'. Phage self-replicate at the site of infection, do not share resistance mechanisms with antibiotics, and may even restore bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics. As IV phage administration has drawbacks including the loss of phage during delivery and long-term exposure to the immune system, we propose here an innovative nanotechnology strategy using our biodegradable delivery system to locally administer lytic phage to treat orthopaedic device-related infections. We have recently demonstrated that phage K, which effectively lyses many strains of Staphylococcus aureus, the most common cause of orthopaedic device-related infections, can be incorporated into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres. Further, eluted phage are able to kill S. aureus within in vitro biofilms on orthopaedic materials. Our long-term goal is to develop effective local delivery of lytic phage to treat multidrug-resistant orthopaedic device-related infections. We plan the following short-term goals: 1) optimize the phage incorporation into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres, 2) generate lytic phage cocktails to treat S. aureus ODRI that eliminate bacterial phage resistance, 3) test of the optimized phage-containing microspheres in in-vitro cell culture and an in-vivo rat model of ODRI. It is anticipated that the investigations proposed in this application will pave the way for clinical trials using local delivery of lytic phage to treat ODRI infections thereby improving patient outcomes.",5,5R21AI176067-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

However, despite the fundamental nature of this discovery, very little is surprisingly known regarding the factors that govern anti-ABO(H) antibody formation or the fine details of the ABO(H) alloantigen targets responsible for hemolytic transfusion reactions (hemolytic transfusion reactions). As a result, current approaches designed to detect ABO(H) antigens and anti-ABO(H) antibodies largely rely on the same agglutination strategy leveraged by Landsteiner over 122 years ago. While ABO(H) incompatible RBC transfusion can result in a hemolytic transfusion reaction (hemolytic transfusion reaction), only half of patients who receive ABO(H) incompatible RBCs experience this outcome. However, the factors that contribute to variable ABO(H) incompatible hemolytic transfusion reactions remain largely unknown. This limitation in our understanding is a direct consequence of the complexity of the post-translational modifications that comprise ABO(H) antigens and a historical limitation in the tools needed to study both ABO(H) antigens and the antibodies that develop against them. While a variety of highly novel tools have begun to revolutionize the field of glycosciences - the study of carbohydrate modifications - these tools have not been as thoroughly applied to perhaps the most common and arguably most clinically significant carbohydrate structures within the human population - ABO(H) blood group antigens. Fundamental questions surrounding anti-ABO(H) antibodies and their target antigens often require disparate areas of expertise, including glycosciences, immunology, hematology and microbiology, which has directly limited the study of this foundational discovery in transfusion medicine. To overcome this challenge, we have assembled a highly collaborative and integrated team of physicians and scientists with expertise in these fields. The combined collaborative history of the Project leaders (>50 papers and >15 years of collaboration) and the use of newly developed models and tools specifically designed to define factors that govern anti-ABO(H) antibody development and the specific ABO(H) targets on RBCs responsible for hemolytic transfusion reactions.

Even with successful buprenorphine initiation, however, adherence is paramount to prevent return to non-medical opioid use and its associated risks. Current methods of determining buprenorphine adherence are limited by their retrospective nature and recall bias. We propose to develop a novel artificial intelligence-assisted wearable sensor system, MINDER, which will continuously monitor physiologic changes, and will use machine learning algorithms to accurately identify buprenorphine use. The MINDER system will be comprised of a custom wearable sensor (MINDER-band), a companion mobile app and a clinician facing portal. The MINDER-band, which is a low profile, upper arm band with a user-driven design, continuously records physiologic data. We will use the band to curate a high-quality dataset of Medications for opioid use disorder ingestions and subsequently use machine learning to evaluate the ability of the sensor to detect Medications for opioid use disorder (specifically buprenorphine) ingestion events. Finally, we will deploy the MINDER system in real-world Medications for opioid use disorder treatment settings to understand usability factors. The investigative team brings together complementary expertise in toxicology/addiction medicine, mobile health (Carreiro, Smelson), machine learning, human computer interaction (Venkatasubramanian), novel on-body wearable sensors, and medical device development (Mankodiya, Solanki).

However, providing micronutrient supplements (micronutrient supplements) alone is not enough. In the Nepali context, the gap between marriage and the first birth is short and newly married women have the lowest household status. Addressing the intersectional barriers to health for newly married women, including inequitable gender norms and women's empowerment, household relationships, nutrition knowledge and practices-is essential for improving maternal and infant outcomes in Nepal. To mitigate the community, household, and individual factors resulting in poor nutrition, our team developed and pilot-tested an educational group intervention (Sumadhur, meaning ""Best Relationship"") for newly married women, husbands, and mothers-in-law triads. Sumadhur aims to provide information on nutrition and women's health, address inequitable gender norms and practices, strengthen household relationships and communication, and improve the household status of newly married women. The pilot study of Sumadhur brought triads of several households together for 16 interrelated sessions over four-months. Findings suggest that participants (N=90) found the intervention to be highly feasible and acceptable and nutritional norms and practices improved. We propose to test the effectiveness of Sumadhur on maternal health and nutrition outcomes using a 2-arm cluster RCT (cluster RCT). The intervention participants will receive the Sumadhur group intervention and will be provided micronutrient supplements directly at group sessions. In control villages who do not receive the Sumadhur group intervention, we will facilitate access to micronutrient supplements at primary health centers. We will randomize 70 villages to each arm (with one group per village). Each village has one group of five women (total of 700 women). Newly married women, their husbands and mothers-in-laws (total=2,100), will be followed four times for 18 months post-intervention through surveys, hemoglobin tests and blood draws (women only). Our specific aims are to estimate the effectiveness of Sumadhur on women's anemia and micronutrient status, including the cost-benefit of the intervention (Aim 1); explore the impact on intermediate outcomes such as gender norms, household relationships and eating practices and characterize the individual and household-level mechanisms of impact (Aim 2); understand triadic experiences and impact over time of Sumadhur (Aim 3). Accomplishing these aims will provide evidence for how to improve micronutrient and anemia status among women before they become pregnant-thereby ensuring that women are not deficient in the critical early phases of pregnancy.

During the previous funding cycles of this award, we have demonstrated that i) successful encapsulation and sustained release of vitamin D and other immunomodulating compounds induced higher cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide) gene and protein (hCAP18/LL37) levels in immune cells and keratinocytes in cell culture, a human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide transgenic mouse wound model and human skin explants; ii) topical vitamin D increased killing of Staphylococcus aureus in a skin wound-infection model using our human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide transgenic mouse; and iii) exosomes secreted from immune cells treated with vitamin D contained higher levels of hCAP18/LL-37. Furthermore, we developed a novel gas-foaming expansion technique to fabricate improved 3D nanofiber scaffolds eluting vitamin D that promoted immune cell infiltration, induced hCAP18/LL-37, decreased inflammation, and promoted neovascularization and collagen deposition in human immune system-engrafted mice. Building on these findings, and our preliminary data, the goal of our proposal focuses on the development of nanofiber-based dressings for enhancing innate immunity. Our overarching hypothesis is that co-encapsulating immunomodulating compounds with exosomes secreted from treated immune cells in 3D nanofiber scaffolds will synergistically enhance protection against surgical site infections and promote wound healing better than either component alone. To accomplish this, there are three specific aims: 1) Demonstrate efficient encapsulation and elution of immunomodulating compounds from our improved 3D nanofiber scaffolds; 2) Determine the antimicrobial and wound-healing efficacy of exosomes derived from primed or human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide transfected immune cells; and 3) Demonstrate the efficacy of immunomodulating compounds and exosomes - co-incorporated 3D nanofiber scaffolds to promote healing and prevent infection in our humanized transgenic mouse model and ex vivo human skin explants.

The underlying hypothesis of the HIV Obstruction by Programmed Epigenetics (HIV Obstruction by Programmed Epigenetics) Collaboratory application is a novel ""block-lock-excise"" approach-that entails the long-term durable silencing of viral expression towards permanent excision of the latent provirus-will lead to the permanent control of the virus in the absence of therapy. A graded transformation of remnant HIV in people living with HIV is proposed from latent into silent to permanently defective proviruses, thus emulating and accelerating the natural path that human endogenous retroviruses have taken in the human genome over millions of years. This hypothesis was formulated on the basis of 30+ years of dedicated research by HIV Obstruction by Programmed Epigenetics investigators into the underlying mechanisms of HIV latency, lack of success to date with latency-reversing strategies, recent results with Tat inhibitor didehydro-Cortistatin A (didehydro-Cortistatin A) and ELITE controllers showing that a successful 'functional' HIV cure could arise if there is a deep silencing of reservoir virus, and the availability of advanced genomeengineering technologies (Brec1 recombinase, peptide nucleic acids, CRISPR-base editors) for direct delivery of the final coup de grace: excision of remnant virus for permanent cure.

The Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort Collaboration (antiretroviral therapy-CC) is the largest collaboration of HIV cohorts across North America and Europe, with 20 HIV cohorts and data on around 250,000 people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy. antiretroviral therapy-CC pioneered standardized coding of causes of death in treated people with HIV and has classified causes of death for 16,832 people with HIV. antiretroviral therapy-CC has fostered a collaborative approach to research and enabled researchers across the globe to utilize its data and methodological expertise. Approaches to analyzing data from HIV cohort collaborations have evolved with increasing awareness of the need to protect participants' privacy, international data protection laws, and wide use of data use agreements to govern data transfers. We will develop a new secure data platform that enables international antiretroviral therapy-CC collaborators and external researchers to conduct secure, privacy-protecting analyses of pseudonymized antiretroviral therapyCC data using reproducible, shared code. data will be accessed in a controlled environment, with export of analysis results requiring approval from trained output checkers. This platform will facilitate a distributed collaborative model in which researchers from any contributing cohort, as well as verified external researchers, can conduct analyses, whilst participating cohorts retain ownership of their data. Research within the secure platform will incorporate 3 aims. 1) Enhance the understanding of cause-specific mortality and cause-specific hospitalizations among people with HIV, building on antiretroviral therapy-CC's world-leading data on causes of death among people with HIV and extending these methods to causes of hospitalization. 2) Enhance understanding of prognosis for all-cause mortality in under-studied groups of people with HIV, such as transgender people with HIV and people with HIV starting antiretroviral therapy aged ≥60. 3) Estimate the comparative effectiveness of novel antiretroviral therapy regimens versus older, more commonly used regimens and of GLP-1 agonists, which are increasingly used to address antiretroviral therapy-associated weight gain in people with HIV. antiretroviral therapy-CC's large size and geographical heterogeneity will allow analyses to be sexstratified and for comparisons between US and non-US cohorts. In summary, this proposal will develop a data platform to simplify data sharing for HIV cohorts in North America and Europe, enabling efficient analyses based on open science principles that address high priority research questions for people with HIV in the modern antiretroviral therapy era.",1,1R01AI181733-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,6,5,3,2

They are associated with significant morbidity and incur substantial healthcare costs. The etiology of DGBI is multifactorial as described by the biopsychosocial model. Psychological distress, including anxiety and depression, is highly associated with DGBI, and cognitive behavioral therapy and its variant guided imagery therapy (guided imagery therapy) are efficacious first-line treatments per experts and clinical guidelines. Unfortunately, individual and systemic barriers often impede regular in-person therapy visits. Alternatively, researchers have demonstrated that remotely delivered CBT and guided imagery therapy via compact discs and websites are efficacious, which led to the development of a K23-supported, patient-centered guided imagery therapy mobile application (guided imagery therapy App). However, our current K23 research nor the medical literature inform best practices for implementing such a therapeutic App in pediatric clinics. Further, our preliminary data shows that our clinicians infrequently refer children with DGBI to any psychological therapy. This proposal aims to identify our clinic personnel's perceived implementation determinants (i.e., barriers and facilitators) for rolling out the guided imagery therapy App within our pediatric clinics. To address this known barrier and discover unforeseen barriers and inherent facilitators possibly affecting the implementation process, this proposal will solicit our clinic personnel's perspectives of these factors to inform a future guided imagery therapy App implementation strategy that can guide clinic personnel activities necessary to promote the implementation of the guided imagery therapy App in this setting. Guided by the theory of Organizational Readiness for Change and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we will use qualitative and quantitative research methods to  assess our clinicians' perspectives about the infrequent referral of patients with DGBI to psychological therapy and  identify perceived barriers and facilitators to the implementation of the guided imagery therapy App intervention in our pediatric clinics. Aim 1 will involve qualitative interviews with clinicians to better understand their views on barriers to referral. For Aim 2, we will use mixed-methods research by first quantitatively assessing clinic personnel's organizational readiness for implementing the guided imagery therapy App intervention within our pediatrics clinics by using the validated Organizational Readiness to Change Assessment (Organizational Readiness to Change Assessment) instrument. Then we will conduct qualitative interviews with the same clinic personnel who have highest and lowest Organizational Readiness to Change Assessment readiness scores and capture their respective perspectives about perceived barriers and facilitators affecting guided imagery therapy App intervention implementation. The combined results of Aims 1 and 2 will inform a guided imagery therapy App implementation strategy for our pediatric clinics that can be evaluated in a future hybrid effectivenessimplementation trial. Results from the current study is likely to be applicable to implementing other therapeutic mobile apps within clinics and also help initiate a sea change in the care delivery of children with DGBI.",1,1R03DK134789-01A1,PAR-22-129,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,1,5,3,2

Nearly a third of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer) present with potentially resectable early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Despite complete resection, approximately 50% of patients with stage II and III non-small cell lung cancer recur and die from metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. There are no reliable biomarkers to predict poor outcomes in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Molecularly targeted therapies and immune checkpoint blockade targeting programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1 (programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) or programmed death ligand-1 (programmed death ligand-1) have significantly improved the outcomes of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and these agents are now undergoing clinical trials in early-stage lung cancer following standard therapy. The National Cancer Institute (National Cancer Institute) has launched an ambitious multicenter study, the Adjuvant Lung Cancer Enrichment Marker Identification and Sequencing (ALCHEMIST), to screen nearly 8000 patients with completely resected non-small cell lung cancer to identify those with activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (epidermal growth factor receptor) tyrosine kinase (tyrosine kinase) and rearrangements in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) to investigate the role of erlotinib and crizotinib, respectively. Those with tumors lacking epidermal growth factor receptor mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement were offered participation in a randomized trial comparing nivolumab, an inhibitor of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1 to observation. The ALCHEMIST Genomics Working Group is planning to study the tumor whole genomes, exomes, and transcriptomes from nearly 2000 patients who did not participate in the intervention trials (ALCHEMIST Screening Study) and all those enrolled in the three ALCHEMIST therapeutic trials. This suite of trials with data generated using genomic analyses provides a unique opportunity to explore the role of the cancer proteome in predicting outcomes in patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer. We propose a Proteogenomic Translational Research Center (Proteogenomic Translational Research Center) to study the proteogenomic alterations in resected early-stage non-small cell lung cancer co-led by the Washington University School of Medicine (Washington University School of Medicine) and the Broad Institute along with investigators affiliated with the National Cancer Institute-funded National Clinical Trials Network (National Clinical Trials Network) supporting the ALCHEMIST suite of clinical trials. Our overarching objective is to apply mass spectrometry-based global and targeted proteomic analyses to patient-derived resected tumor material to improve upon the predictive biomarkers using somatic cancer genome and transcriptome and clinical characteristics. These discoveries will be translated into targeted assays to predict recurrence following therapy. Since the ALCHEMIST Crizotinib study is still ongoing and has enrolled relatively fewer patients compared to other studies, we will not include those samples in this proposal. The three aims of this project are to develop prognostic assessment tools to predict relapse in patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer treated with standard platinum doublet chemotherapy (aim 1), standard platinum doublet chemotherapy and nivolumab (aim 2), and standard platinum doublet chemotherapy and erlotinib (aim 3) using proteogenomics.",5,5U01CA271402-03,RFA-CA-21-025,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Resilience programs have arisen as a promising workplace strategy to improve mental health and well-being for those at greatest risk; however, emerging programs are limited by timeand resource-intensive in-person strategies limiting scalability and practicality for the most marginalized of the workforce. Additionally, the literature on resilience programs are largely from preliminary studies that lack of a priori sample size calculations, diversity of participants, and long-term maintenance following the intervention, as well as inadequate control groups, which limits translation prompting calls for more rigorous designs to evaluate the efficacy of these programs. Consistent with the aim of PAR-24-086 to test a fully remotely delivered clinical trial with no in-person contact, this team has developed and translated the Stress Management and Resilience Training (Stress Management and Resilience Training) program for web-based delivery. Our pilot work demonstrates feasibility, usability, satisfaction, and initial efficacy of the brief self-paced web-based learning sessions (1 hour per week) with only 5-10 minutes of daily practice suggesting a fully powered study is timely and warranted. An adequately powered, cluster randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the web-based Stress Management and Resilience Training program compared to a matched attention control in a high-need, diverse, and under-resourced and under-studied segment of essential workers - childcare workers - will be conducted. Participants (640 childcare workers from 80 childcare centers) will be randomly assigned to either Stress Management and Resilience Training or a matched attention control condition with the primary outcome of mean change in resilience assets and resources (Connor-Davison Resilience Scale). Measures will be collected at four timepoints: baseline (0 months), post-intervention (3 months), and long-term maintenance (9 and 15 months). Secondary outcomes will include changes in overall mental health, negative and positive mental health indicators, social support, and organizational assets and resources. Additionally, we will explore potential moderators' (e.g., sociodemographic, social determinants of health) influence on treatment effects. The RE-AIM Framework will be used to determine reach and representativeness, and potential for organizational level adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the Stress Management and Resilience Training program. This study fills key research gaps of previous resilience work in an underserved population in critical need of mental health and well-being resources with implications for the feasibility and impact of remote programming in other marginalized segments of the workforce.",1,1R01AT012620-01A1,PAR-24-086,NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY & INTEGRATIVE HEALTH,6,5,3,2

Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN, neutrophils) release reactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen species) to combat infection, but this inflammatory response can also initiate and propagate lung damage. Acute lung injury (Acute lung injury) and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome) that is fatal in 40% of patients, are characterized by accumulation of albumin-rich fluid in the pulmonary air spaces. Drug therapies focused on downstream cytokine actions have failed to improve morbidity or mortality; we hypothesize, and offer evidence, that targeting the human voltage-gated proton channel (hHv1) at early steps can be more effective. We propose to target hHv1 because (i) the channel in PMN initiates and sustains the inflammatory response, (ii) C6, a unique blocker of hHv1 suppresses human PMN reactive oxygen species production, and (iii) C6 suppresses lung compromise in an Acute lung injury mouse model. Brief background. This application builds on advances in the last period when we created the first high-affinity and specific direct blocker of hHv1 (C6 peptide) and used it to show, first, that human sperm require hHv1-mediated H+ efflux to initiate capacitation, allowing the acrosomal reaction, and oocyte fertilization and, second, that hHv1 in human PMN is required to produce and sustain release of inflammatory agents, including reactive oxygen species and proteases, during the innate immune inflammatory response. Unique features and innovation. Our pilot data reveal a second target in the pathway: albumin (albumin) is required to activate hHv1 in human PMN and we describe a peptide (L*) that blocks albumin-activation and reactive oxygen species production. Supporting our driving hypothesis, we show here that both C6 and L* inhibit hHv1 in human PMN, decreasing reactive oxygen species production, and that C6 protects in an Acute lung injury mouse model, restoring lung compliance, and decreasing reactive oxygen species, proinflammatory cytokines, protein, and PMN in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. We employ our novel membrane tethered (T-peptide) method to speed structure-function studies and peptide design, show a bivalent C6 (C62) that fully inhibits open hHv1 channels, benefit from advanced biophysical and in vivo methods, and two expert collaborators. Three specific aims.  albumin activation of hHv1 seeks the structural and mechanistic basis for the action of albumin and a more potent natural metabolite.  albumin regulation of the PMN inflammatory response seeks to delineate the role of hHv1 in PMN using C6, C62 and L* and the basis for peptide action.  Inhibiting acute lung injury with Hv1 inhibitors studies an Acute lung injury model in WT and Hv1 KO mice. Significance. This work addresses an unmet medical need, recently made more apparent by the advent of COVID-19-related Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome and has broader influence because Hv1 in PMN and other phagocytes is complicit in additional acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. We propose to apply unique hHv1 inhibitors and innovative methods to understand and suppress this pathophysiology.",5,5R01HL159711-09,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",3,4,0,3

While this approach has led to the successful treatment of hundreds of patients on clinical trials or with commercial CAR-T cell therapies, from a drug development standpoint this approach is inefficient. By targeting a pan-hematologic antigen, a single ""drug"" could be used for all indications, thereby accelerating clinical research. CD45 is a receptor tyrosine phosphatase that is expressed on the surface of most hematopoietic cells, from immature stem cells to differentiated progeny. As expected, antibody-drug conjugates targeting CD45 cause profound myeloablation and are in clinical development as conditioning agents prior to stem cell transplantation. A unique hurdle limiting the use of anti-CD45 CAR T cells (CART-45) is that T cells themselves express CD45, and CART45 are therefore vulnerable to fratricide. Furthermore, CD45 is crucial for proper function of the T cell immune synapse. The overarching goal of this project is to render CD45 targetable using genetic engineering of T cells and of hematopoietic stem cells (hematopoietic stem cells). To achieve this goal, we will test the central hypothesis that site-specific mutation of CD45 in hematopoietic cells (including T cells) can abrogate recognition by CART-45 while retaining all other domains required for the function of this molecule. We expect that this approach will prevent T cell dysfunction and myeloablation. This will be accomplished in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will generate fratricide-resistant CD45-targeting CAR-T cells. We have identified a candidate CAR construct based on unbiased functional screening and shown that CART-45 are indeed subject to fratricide. While this fratricide could be rescued by CRISPR-based knock out of CD45, CD45-deficient CART cells were dysfunctional. Using alanine mutagenesis, we then identified the target epitope on CD45 that is recognized by our lead CAR candidate and we have now successfully edited this epitope to abrogate fratricide, resulting in CAR-T cells that recognize native CD45 in trans without themselves being the target of anti-CD45 CAR. In this aim we will test the hypothesis that the function of CD45-edited T cells is equivalent to unmodified control T cells, and superior to that of CD45deleted T cells. In Aim 2, we will genetically engineer hematopoietic stem cells to generate a CART-resistant hematopoietic system. To demonstrate that engineered CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells's are resistant to CD45 targeted CAR-T cell therapy, engineered HSPC's will be engrafted into immunodeficient mice followed by treatment with CD45 CAR-T cells. Finally, to target CD45 in human AML we will disrupt CD45 expression in primary human AML and test leukemogenicity in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 3 up to 6 patients will undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation using donor stem cells where CD45 expression has been edited using CRISPR/Cas9, followed by infusion of donor-derived CART-45. Successful completion of this Aim will provide proof-of-concept for our overall strategy to create a leukemia-specific antigen using gene editing tools.",5,5P01CA214278-07,PAR-20-077,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,16,0,4,4

While a number of celland tissue-based therapies can limit this dysfunction, the proportion of cells that survive at the site of administration for more than a few weeks after transplantation is extremely low. As such, substantial remuscularization of the infarcted region has rarely been reported; and when limited remuscularization has been reported, it is frequently accompanied by potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias of unknown mechanism. This proposal aims at remuscularization of the injured ventricle by the definition of key endogenous factors that regulate and promote the cell cycle of the native cardiomyocyte (cardiomyocyte), and from exogenous transplanted bioengineered cardiac muscle patch (hcardiomyocyteP) that overexpresses key regulators of cardiomyocyte cell cycle, and will incorporate a functional vascular network and recapitulate some of the key micro environmental cues of native heart tissue. We recently established a novel hiPSC cell line with MHC-driven overexpression of a key regulator of cardiomyocytes: CCND2 (hiPSC-MHC-CCND2OE), which can remuscularize injured ventricle in rodent model. The central objective of this proposal is to ""turn back the clock"" of the myocyte cell cycle, which will facilitate myocardial repair. The Specific Aims (Specific Aims) that will examine this objective include: Specific Aims1: To identify the key regulators that promote cell-cycle activity in the hearts of early neonatal pigs after myocardial injury. We will: 1) using state-of-the-art fate-mapping molecular biology and imaging technologies, and the single cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (scRNAseq or snRNAseq) technology demonstrate the key regulators/signaling pathways that govern the myocyte cell cycle; and 2) test the remuscularization of the injured ventricle by manipulating the key regulators using either targeted modRNA or AAV9 delivery strategies to selectively modify these regulators in adult pig hearts following ischemic injury. Specific Aims2a. To engineer hcardiomyocytePs containing cardiomyocytes that are capable of proliferating after transplantation, and characterized by previously unattainable size and thickness that are functionally mature and primed for in-vivo vascularization. Specific Aims2b. To evaluate the effectiveness of our hcardiomyocyteP constructs for myocardial recovery and remuscularization in a large-animal (pig) model of myocardial injury. We will use state-of-the-art techniques that includes optical mapping in combination with the 3dimensional intramural cardiac mapping to delineate the potential arrhythmia mechanisms over the entire transmural and left ventricular surface. These studies will synergize with the other projects and serve as a prelude for therapeutic initiatives focused on remuscularization of the injured human heart.",5,5P01HL160476-03,PAR-21-088,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,2,0,0

Our proposal focuses on the biogenesis and catabolism of atherogenic apoBcontaining lipoproteins (apoBcontaining lipoproteins), which are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. ApoB-Lps comprise both cholesterol and triglycerides (triglycerides). Whereas reducing cholesterol is well established to reduce atherosclerosis, it remains to be convincingly determined whether decreasing levels of triglycerides or the apoBcontaining lipoproteins that carry triglycerides will decrease cardiovascular disease. Blocking secretion of apoBcontaining lipoproteins by the liver reduces levels of cholesterol-rich apoBcontaining lipoproteins, such as LDL and its TG-rich precursor VLDL. Unfortunately, such approaches have led to hepatosteatosis. However, human genetic mutation and animal studies demonstrate that reduced liver secretion of triglycerides does not invariably cause steatosis. By characterizing novel factors and pathways regulating liver apoB-Lp production, intravascular lipolysis, and adipose TG retention and mobilization, we will identify unique targets to reduce circulating apoBLps, their infiltration into the artery wall, and atherosclerosis. We will define basic mechanisms in cells and in new rodent models and then correlate our discoveries with human data, emphasizing a translational and transfomative approach. Our overall goals are to: 1) identify new processes and factors regulating circulating TG and FA levels, 2) investigate the lipidation and intracellular transport of apoB in hepatocytes, and 3) study how different apoBcontaining lipoproteins interact with cells and ultimately catalyze atherogenesis. This application comprises three projects (P1-P3) that have integrated work from three established investigators of apoB-Lp metabolism and atherosclerosis. P1 will investigate the role of adipose MTP and FIT2 in regulating adipose lipolysis, circulating lipids, hepatic apoB-Lp production, and atherosclerosis. P2 will study two poorly characterized proteins in the liver, KLHL12 and FIT2, which control hepatic apoB-Lp lipid-loading and secretion, and the composition of atherogenic apoBcontaining lipoproteins. P3 will study how TG-rich apoBcontaining lipoproteins interact with the vascular wall, and specifically determine the role of the N-terminal region of apoB on lipid uptake and transcytosis of apoBcontaining lipoproteins by vascular ECs and their links to atherosclerosis. The PPG has an administrative core and three scientific cores (C1-C3). The Administrative Core will oversee the overall PPG function and finances. To assist P1-P3, C1 will provide biostatistics and bioinformatics support, C2 will perform lipidomics and proteomics on apoBcontaining lipoproteins and tissues and provide human samples, and C3 will perform state-of-the-art atherosclerosis assays. Our studies will generate novel mouse models invaluable to understand the factors that regulate lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, identify new therapeutic targets, and better define how high circulating levels of atherogenic apoBcontaining lipoproteins and other factors contribute to atherogenesis. Dissecting pathways that regulate the production and atherogenicity of apoBLps promises to reveal novel approaches to reduce cardiovascular disease. This requires the integration of reseach in our three projects, as experiments in each require assistance from the others and core resources.",5,5P01HL160470-02,PAR-21-088,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",12,2,0,0

The primary function of Core A is to serve human and porcine myocardial and stellate ganglion tissue needs across all projects and Core B. Given significant regulatory and logistical hurdles needed to procure and study human heart and stellate ganglion tissues, it is ideal for this to be handled by a central core. The core will perform three key functions for the study: 1) tissue clearing and ultrastructural imaging; 2) procurement of normal (or near normal) and diseased human tissues, specifically hearts and stellate ganglia; and 3) molecular biology. All 3 projects of this PPG with utilize at least two of these services, and there will be tight links between this core and Core B, the Functional Assessment and Instrumentation Core. Over the past 15 months, we have built a pipeline to obtain diseased hearts from patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation, and normal or near normal hearts rejected for organ transplant. Our infrastructure for obtained stellate ganglia from patients with cardiomyopathy undergoing stellectomy, and stellate ganglia from patients without cardiopulmonary disease at the time of heart and/or lung donation has existed for 5 years. Given the unpredictable times at which these tissues become available, centralizing the tissue procurement activities within this core will benefit the PPG by streamlining protocols and approvals, minimizing cost, and boosting productivity. The Core will also streamline the 4-week process of tissue clearing from pigs and humans by batching tissues to minimize error, tissue clearing involves numerous steps and chemicals. Finally, it is most ideal that tissues are cleared and imaged in high resolution in close coordination with study team members from Projects 1-3 in this Core whether or not the tissues are cleared.

At high frame rates, conventional two-photon fluorescence microscopy (2PFM) methods are limited in their achievable fields of view by their point-scanning mechanisms. Although camera-based one-photon widefield fluorescence microscopy (1PWM) can be used to image fast activity events at kilohertz frame rates, it requires sparse fluorescence labeling/excitation and is limited to superficial tissue depths. Previously, we implemented an all-optical and passive ultrafast laser-scanning technique called free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay (free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay) in 2PFM. Capable of generating millions of line scans per second, our free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay module has enabled 2PFM to image large fields of view at kilohertz frame rates. Applying free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay 2PFM to the mouse brain in vivo, we recorded supraand sub-threshold electrical activity and characterized ultrafast cortical blood flow dynamics deep below the brain surface. Here, we aim to further optimize free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay technology to maximize its accessibility and impact. First, we will develop a free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay module with fully motorized positioning and active beam stabilization, to enable alignment-free operation with flexible configuration. We will also build software support for free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay data acquisition into ScanImage, a widely used 2PFM control program. Together, the development of user-friendly hardware and software will facilitate the adoption of free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay in labs that specialize in biological applications. Next, we will expand the impact of free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay on fast neural imaging into the mesoscale by integrating a free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay module into a two-photon mesoscope, with the resulting 10-30× speed gain enabling the recording of neuronal activity over 20 mm2 in vivo. Finally, to overcome the limitations of 1PWM in voltage imaging, we will build a kilohertz-frame-rate single-photon confocal microscope using free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay to enable voltage imaging in both sparsely and densely labeled brains, while developing new far-red voltage sensors to maximize the imaging depth of this approach. The proposed work will substantially broaden the impact of free-space angular-chirp-enhanced delay technology by making it accessible to and capable of answering a wide variety of neuroscience questions.",1,1U01NS137449-01,RFA-NS-24-005,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,11,8,2,0

However, a rate-limiting challenge for the field has been how to identify the specific variants, elements and regulated genes that mediate these effects on disease liability. Towards the overall goals of the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (Impact of Genomic Variation on Function) Consortium, we propose to test over one million human regulatory elements or variants for their functional effects on transcriptional regulation, as well as to query over 100,000 distal regulatory elements for the gene(s) that they regulate. A first theme of our proposal is the diversity of multiplex technologies that we will employ to these ends, including massively parallel reporter assays (massively parallel reporter assays), crisprQTL, saturation genome editing, multiplex prime editing and single cell combinatorial indexing, many of which we pioneered. A second theme is a focus on dynamic cellular systems that enable a given library of variants and/or elements to be tested across a broad range of cell types and states within a single experiment; these will include ESC-derived neuronal progenitors, cardiomyocytes, embryoid bodies, gastruloids and organoids, and in select cases, mice. A third theme involves leveraging our experience (e.g. CADD, a widely used, genome-wide catalog of variant effect predictions) to support the overarching goals of Impact of Genomic Variation on Function. Specifically, we envision using functional measurements generated by us and others to produce well-calibrated predictions of enhancer activity and variant effects that are continuous along the branching trajectories that comprise human development. Our specific aims are as follows:  To perform massively parallel validation and functional characterization of candidate human enhancers in a broad range of cell type contexts.  To perform massively parallel characterization of human genetic variants with potential roles in human disease.  To contribute to a comprehensive variant-element-phenotype catalog while taking a leadership role in synergistic interactions within Impact of Genomic Variation on Function, in the dissemination of methods, data and predictions, and in the overarching goals of the consortium.",5,5UM1HG011966-04,RFA-HG-20-043,NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE,11,8,2,0

HIV largely resides outside of the peripheral circulation, and thus, numerous anatomical and lymphoid compartments that have the capacity to harbor HIV are inaccessible to routine sampling. Novel, non-invasive, in vivo methods are urgently needed to address this fundamental gap in knowledge. We recently completed the pre-clinical development, animal testing, and first-in-human PETmagnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies of 89Zr-VRC01. In a pilot feasibility study of 15 participants, we observed significantly increased 89Zr-VRC01 uptake in various lymphoid and other tissues in HIV-infected individuals with detectable viremia and on suppressive antiretroviral therapy compared to uninfected controls. Importantly, PET tracer uptake in inguinal lymph nodes in viremic and antiretroviral therapy-suppressed participants who underwent lymph node sampling significantly and positively correlated with HIV protein expression measured directly in cells. These exciting data suggest the PET imaging of the HIV reservoir has the potential to advance the field of HIV curative strategies. Our goals are to determine the anatomical location and temporal dynamics of HIV infection in viremic and antiretroviral therapy-suppressed individuals and validate the tracer uptake with true measures of HIV infection. We will study location and dynamics before and after antiretroviral therapy and during a separately funded, highly monitored treatment interruption protocol which will begin enrolling during the first year of our proposed study. Throughout these studies, we will simultaneously measure the reservoir directly (using lymph node and gut samples) and compare these tissue assessments of the HIV reservoir to the total 89Zr-VRC01 uptake by PET-MR imaging. We have established close collaborations with the EXPLORER imaging program at UC Davis. This unique PET technology has the highest sensitivity of any existing human scanner which will likely prove to be critically important in imaging HIV reservoirs among individuals on long-term antiretroviral therapy. We recently completed EXPLORER imaging in two HIV-infected individuals and show dramatic increases in image resolution and signal/noise ratios. We hypothesize that PET-MR imaging using 89Zr-VRC01 in conjunction with the EXPLORER platform will provide a quantifiable, non-invasive measure of tissue-wide reservoirs and will identify anatomical foci of HIV recrudescence. Our aims are to: (1a) quantify 89Zr-VRC01 PET activity in HIV-infected participants (antiretroviral therapysuppressed, HIV controller, viremic) and matched uninfected controls, (1b) compare 89Zr-VRC01 uptake before and after initiation of antiretroviral therapy, and (1c) determine the correlation between PET signal and tissue measures of HIV burden,  determine if the ultra-sensitive EXPLORER platform will increase the ability of 89Zr-VRC01 PET imaging to detect persistent HIV in antiretroviral therapy-suppressed individuals, and,  determine the anatomical foci of HIV recrudescence during ATI using the 89Zr-VRC01 PET, PET-MR, and EXPLORER platforms.",5,5R01AI152932-04,PA-17-305,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

While birthweight has been linked to these outcomes, it may be only a proxy reflecting a complex interplay of genetics and environment that defines a common etiology between birthweight and later life health, and which defines the Developmental Origins of Heath and Disease (Developmental Origins of Heath and Disease) hypothesis. Supporting this hypothesis are a number of large, genome-wide association studies (genome-wide association studies) that have identified genetic variants associated with early life outcomes, such as birthweight and childhood obesity, body mass index and adiposity, and have demonstrated that these same variants can also impact adult cardiovascular traits and disease. Thus, early intervention, either through identifying at-risk population and/or targeting functional variations induced by genetic and environmental factors, could be highly effective in reducing overall disease burden. Our team spearheaded the placental research suggesting that the placenta may be the critical organ for much of childhood health programming. This proposal is framed on the hypothesis that the functional genome of a placenta acts as a critical and unique mediator of the in utero environment (both genetic and non-genetic) to influence birthweight and program postnatal growth and development, and such effects may occur in particular cellular components of the placenta. Leveraging the resources of three well-characterized and diverse birth cohorts in the US, we propose a rigorous integrative genomics and systems biology investigation to demonstrate the causal, mechanistic role of the placenta in postnatal health programming using state-of-the-art, post-genome-wide association studies, functional genomic investigations, including innovative use of single-nucleus RNA sequencing technology and molecular quantitative trait loci analyses (molecular quantitative trait loci analyses). We will build a comprehensive molecular atlas of human term placenta to identify functional molecular features that mediate birthweight genome-wide association studies hits as well as those independent of genetics, and we will build a placental transcriptomic atlas at cellular resolution to improve mechanistic understanding of the role of the placenta at the single cell level. Furthermore, we will examine prospective associations of the birthweightrelated molecular features in placenta with growth trajectory, childhood obesity, BMI, and adiposity at age 5 as a model of the placenta's role in long-term health programming. This project aligns with the research priorities of Pregnancy and Perinatology Branch of the NICHD, in defining ""molecular biology processes involved in normal and abnormal placentation"" as well as ""genetic and epigenetic factors that adversely affect pregnancy outcomes"". Results from our study will pave the way for the development of placenta-based biomarkers to be assessed at birth for prospective risk stratification into childhood so early intervention may be implemented; they will also help identify mechanistic pathways useful in defining prevention or intervention strategies to alleviate long-term disease burden.",5,5R01HD108310-02,PA-20-185,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,1,3,3,2

SECTION HEADER The project's long-term goal is to reduce health complications for diabetic Muslims who fast during Ramadan. This proposal focuses on understanding the healthcare needs of fasting Type 2 diabetic Muslims and identifying current gaps in the capacity of dietitians to respond to the needs of this population. This study addresses 3 specific aims: 1) Determine dietitians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding providing care to fasting Muslims; 2) Assess the perspectives of Muslims with diabetes regarding the healthcare they have received concerning how to manage fasting; and 3) Integrate the perspectives of dietitians and Muslims to inform the development of care guidelines for fasting diabetic Muslims. The research design uses a cross sectional survey to assess dietitians' knowledge, attitude, and practices to provide care to fasting Muslims; focus groups with dietitians to explore the barriers, challenges, and opportunities dietitians experience while providing culturally sensitive care; and in-depth interviews with diabetic Muslims to understand their healthcare experiences related to managing fasting. Aim 3 will involve the comparison of data collected during Aims 1 and 2 to determine a) whether Muslims' healthcare experiences align with or diverge from dietitians' perception of their capacity to provide culturally safe care and b) support the development of an overall conceptual framework. This proposal aligns with the NIH mission by engaging in research focused on enhancing the health and reducing illness and disability among fasting diabetic Muslims.",1,1R16GM154706-01,PAR-21-173,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,1,3,3,2

Healthcare disparities have resulted in cervical cancer incidence and mortality that are five times higher in low and middle income countries (low and middle income countries) than in high-income countries. In the United States, cervical cancer mortality rates are twice as high among rural women than their urban counterparts. The wide disparity in cervical cancer incidence rates and deaths is attributed to both higher HPV infection rates and a lack of accessible screening and treatment of pre-invasive cervical lesions. The current standard of care in the US, a cytology-based Pap smear, requires resource intensive laboratory and clinical specialists with a long turnaround time from sample collection to result. Alternatives, such as visual inspection with acetic acid and emerging HPV-targeted tests, have poor specificity for cervical cancer, leading to overtreatment that can cause complications including infertility and pre-term births and that further the burden on limited healthcare resources. This proposal aims to create an integrated point-of-care screening test that can be used by healthcare providers in under-resourced settings to obtain relevant clinical insights, including cervical cancer risk stratification, and enable same-visit treatment of high risk cervical lesions. Building on our preliminary development of a highly sensitive paper-based immunoassay to test for the key cervical cancer biomarker, valosin containing protein (valosin containing protein), the objective of this proposal is to combine valosin containing protein detection with three other known cervical cancer protein biomarkers, in a sensitive and specific single-step pointof-care assay. Specific milestones include: 1) Integrating and optimizing multiplex detection of cervical cancer biomarkers into a simple paper-based sample-to-answer device. 2) Evaluating the operational and performance metrics of the test in retrospective cervical swab samples. The outcome of this proposal will be a highly characterized point-of-care test with high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (90%) to detect high-risk cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer within 40 minutes. This affordable solution for cervical cancer screening and control programs will be applicable in low and middle income countries and will provide highly sensitive monitoring of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in the US, where it will be especially impactful in high-risk populations that are currently underserved by existing screening programs.",5,5R01CA246315-05,PAR-19-158,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,1,5,3,2

HIV testing and subsequent engagement in HIV prevention and care services are suboptimal among people who inject drugs (people who inject drugs) due to multilevel barriers including low healthcare utilization, stigma, homelessness, and limited transportation. HIV self-testing (HIV self-testing) is a discreet, convenient, and empowering HIV testing strategy with great potential to increase HIV testing coverage among people who inject drugs. Syringe service programs (Syringe service programs), which successfully promote the secondary distribution (i.e., peer delivery) of sterile syringes, naloxone, and other harm reduction supplies, are uniquely poised to increase the reach of HIV self-testing into the social networks of their clients (i.e., people who inject drugs). Leveraging our existing partnership with the Inland Empire Harm Reduction (Inland Empire Harm Reduction) SSP in the Ending the HIV Epidemic (Ending the HIV Epidemic) priority jurisdiction of Riverside County (Riverside County), California, this project seeks to develop and evaluate the ""Prevention Ambassadors"" (Prevention Ambassadors"") intervention to promote HIV testing and engagement in HIV prevention and care services among people who inject drugs via the secondary distribution of HIV self-testing kits with local HIV service information and referrals to HIV service navigation (hereafter ""HIV self-testing plus information/referrals"") in the social networks of SSP clients. This novel intervention, informed by the Diffusion of Innovations (Diffusion of Innovations) theory, adapts effective social network-based HIV prevention interventions for people who inject drugs to extend Inland Empire Harm Reduction's secondary distribution of sterile syringes and naloxone (i.e., Inland Empire Harm Reduction standard of care; SOC) to include HIV self-testing plus information/referrals. In this two-phase project, we will first engage in an iterative process with people who inject drugs and SSP/HIV service providers in Riverside County to adapt, pretest, and refine Prevention Ambassadors"" to train people who inject drugs (indexes) to distribute HIV self-testing plus information/referrals to other people who inject drugs in their social networks (peer-recruits; AIM 1). Next, we will pilot Prevention Ambassadors"" with 50 indexes randomized 1:1 to Prevention Ambassadors"" or SOC to examine the preliminary effect of Prevention Ambassadors"" (vs. SOC) on indexes' and ~100 peer-recruits' HIV testing and HIV service engagement outcomes (linkage to PrEP/HIV care, PrEP/ART uptake; AIM 2); explore whether individual and social network characteristics modify the effects of Prevention Ambassadors"" (AIM 3); and explore Prevention Ambassadors"" acceptability, feasibility, and areas for refinement among indexes, peer-recruits, and local SSP/HIV service providers using a mixed-methods approach (AIM 4). Outcomes will be assessed via surveys, medical records, and qualitative interviews. Findings will support a future R01 efficacy trial and potential Prevention Ambassadors"" dissemination to other Syringe service programs nationally to accelerate efforts to end the HIV epidemic among people who inject drugs.",5,5R34DA058389-02,RFA-DA-23-007,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,6,5,3,2

Two countries particularly impacted by tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure are Armenia (Armenia) and Georgia (Georgia), which represent the 11th and 6th highest smoking rates in men globally (51.5% and 55.5%, respectively). However, smoking prevalence is much lower among women (1.8% and 7.8%). Notably, a primary source of secondhand smoke exposure among children and most nonsmoking adults in many lowand middle-income countries, including Armenia and Georgia, is the home. Smoke-free homes (Smoke-free homes) can reduce secondhand smoke exposure, promote cessation, and possibly disrupt initiation; however, 61.4% of households in Armenia and Georgia allow smoking in the home. Thus, promoting Smoke-free homes may be an innovative and relatively untapped strategy for chronic disease prevention in these countries - and in other lowand middle-income countries with high smoking rates. Research focused on implementing evidence-based interventions (evidence-based interventions) offers unique opportunities to address the pressing needs in lowand middle-income countries and to examine key barriers in the adoption, scale-up, and sustainment of evidence-based interventions in low-resource settings. This proposal builds on ongoing collaborations among MPIs Berg and Kegler, the Georgia National Center for Disease Control (National Center for Disease Control), the Armenia National Institute of Health (National Institute of Health), and the American University of Armenia (American University of Armenia), dating back to 2013. These collaborations have established: 1) a strong community-based infrastructure for implementing public health programs using local coalitions in 14 communities, developed in our current Fogarty-funded R01; and 2) a theory-based Smoke-free homes intervention, designed to be brief and adaptable and shown to be effective, generalizable, scalable, and cost-effective among low-income households in the US. The current proposal will strategically capitalize on our strong partnerships with national public health agencies, local community mobilization infrastructure, and SFH EBI to address our specific aims. Aim 1: We will adapt our SFH intervention to be culturally appropriate for the Armenia and Georgia populations, using a community-engaged approach and robust adaptation frameworks and methods, and develop in-country capacity for intervention dissemination (via local coalitions) and delivery (via national quitlines). Aim 2: We will examine the effectiveness of the adapted intervention (vs. control) on SFH adoption (primary outcome) among households in Armenia and Georgia, using a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation RCT (n=550 participants; 275/country), with follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months. Aim 3: We will assess intervention reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance potential, as well as related contextual influences, using a mixed-methods process evaluation guided by RE-AIM. Our team (including national public health agencies) will use these findings to develop a sustainability and dissemination plan (e.g., intervention packaging for scale-up). This work will provide a robust model for adapting and implementing this EBI for Armenia and Georgia, which could then be used for this intervention in other countries and/or for other behavioral targets and evidence-based interventions in Armenia, Georgia, and elsewhere. This work will advance our long-term goals of building the knowledge base informing strategies to reduce tobacco-related disparities globally and the implementation and scale-out of evidence-based interventions in lowand middle-income countries.",5,5R01CA278229-02,PAR-19-274,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,6,5,8,2

Prematurity is associated with smaller brain regions that are correlated with lower developmental scores. Moreover, up to 75% preterm infants experience systemic inflammation that is also associated with lower developmental scores and brain white matter injury. In contrast, human milk (human milk) feeding is associated with better neurodevelopment in both term and preterm infants. Current literature suggests both prematurity and neonatal inflammation may contribute to neurodevelopmental hindrance. This study will be the first to examine the molecular mechanisms of how human milk affects the gut-brain axis (intestinal, systemic, and brain inflammation) and to validate relevant human biomarkers for clinical use. There is a critical need to determine how human milk improves neurocognitive outcomes to inform clinical practice guidelines. The long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind how human milk improves neurodevelopment in preterm infants. The overall objective is to determine the effects of different early-life feedings on intestinal barrier function; intestinal, systemic, and brain inflammation; and neurocognitive development using the high homology neonatal piglet model and validate relevant non-invasive human biomarkers. The central hypothesis is that early human milk feeding preserves intestinal barrier function and reduces intestinal, systemic, and brain inflammation thus improving neurocognitive development. The approach will use a clinically relevant piglet model to 1) compare intestinal growth, inflammation, and barrier function between human milk and infant formula (infant formula) feedings; 2) assess systemic inflammatory differences between feeding groups; and 3) determine neurocognitive function, brain growth, and neuroinflammation as a function of the feeding groups. This research is innovative because it will be the first study to combine functional, histological, and molecular methods to directly examine the complex mechanisms of how different feeding regimens affect interrelationships between the intestinal, systemic, and neurological systems in relation to neurodevelopment without the common confounding factors in human observational studies. Further, this research will validate non-invasive human biomarkers to enhance research translation. The expectation is to determine the direct effects of human milk and infant formula feedings at the intestinal, systemic, and brain levels, and whether these feedings modify intestinal barrier function, immune tissue development, and neurodevelopment. The critical knowledge gained from this study will positively impact the field by directing subsequent research and shaping clinical practice guidelines with evidence to optimize early feeding that may significantly impact the infant's ability to: 1) fight systemic inflammation, and 2) mitigate long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. The results from this proposed research will also provide useful non-invasive biomarkers to help monitor developmental and inflammatory status of the infants while modifying feeding mixtures to ensure achievement of optimal developmental outcomes.",1,1R56HD113572-01,PA-20-185,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,1,3,3,2

Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (Proteolysis-targeting chimeras) and associated molecules that induce targeted protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system have emerged as a revolutionary strategy for addressing ""undruggable"" targets. However, despite the groundbreaking advances and entry of some Proteolysis-targeting chimeras into clinical trials, substantial challenges and considerable room for further development remain. Limitations of current Proteolysis-targeting chimeras include poor cell permeability, limited availability of E3 ligands, and poor selectivity, highlighting a critical need for ongoing innovations in Targeted Protein Degradation (Targeted Protein Degradation) technology. To address these issues, the possibility of developing an efficacious drug delivery system, coupled with conditional activation of target protein degradation, stands out as a pivotal enhancement. In this context, nucleic acid-based modalities offer considerable promise for advancing Targeted Protein Degradation, building on the successful biomedical applications of nucleic acid-based drugs like antisense oligonucleotides (antisense oligonucleotides). The programmable and addressable nature of DNA or RNA nanostructures has been successfully harnessed, allowing for functional integration with small molecules, proteins, and peptides to realize applications in drug delivery, vaccines, and biosensors, among others. Based on these prior successes, we hypothesize that by leveraging the inherent programmability and addressability of DNA, precise and effective delivery of protein degradation modalities into cells and conditional activation of degradation can be achieved. For proof-of-concept validation, we have established an efficient cytoplasmic delivery platform utilizing a multifunctional DNA nanodevice and developed a DNA-based target protein degradation system (DTAC) capable of degrading CDK4/6 proteins at nanomolar concentrations. Building on these accomplishments, we intend to integrate our delivery platform with the DNAbased protein degradation system, aiming to pioneer the next generation of Targeted Protein Degradation technologies. Our approach aims to 1) optimize the programmability of our DNA duplex-based protein degradation system by transitioning from DNA duplex structures to multitargeting DNA nanostructures; 2) assess protein degradation variations caused by spatial distances and evaluate the efficiency of multi-target degradation; 3) integrate and optimize the cytoplasmic DNA nanostructure delivery system with the DNA-based protein degradation system; and 4) validate and optimize the conditional activation of protein degradation through two distinct design approaches: i) toehold mediated conditional activity of DTAC and ii) allosteric mediated conditional activity of DTAC.",1,1R01GM155563-01,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

Chloride homeostasis is maintained inside the cell while the chloride level is varied based on the function of organelles. Dysregulation of chloride homeostasis caused by the mutation of chloride channels results in various human diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CFTR, >70,000 people worldwide), proteinuria and kidney stones (ClC-5, 39 million people in US), Osteoporosis (ClC-7, 10 million people in US, 43 million people in the risk group). Although five FDA-approved chloride channel modulators have been reported, they only target plasma membrane chloride channels due to the technical barrier. There is no FDA-approved or clinical trial drug that targets organellar chloride channel. The field of chloride channel-targeted therapy is still under-studied (5 FDA-approved drugs, 2 clinical trial) compared to other channels such as calcium, potassium, and sodium. The lack of understanding of the physiological role of organellar chloride and the well-characterized chloride channel are the biggest roadblocks for the development of chloride channel-targeted therapy. Therefore, suitable research tools with a high resolving ability to examine the organelle chloride in live cells is a highly urgent need, which is essential to elucidate the physiological role of organellar chloride and characterize the chloride channel. However, the current chloride measurement with one-dimensional analysis only shows the average ion level. It cannot observe the chloride level change in a minor subset of organelles triggered by the cellular pathway such as STING and autophagy. Furthermore, the typical fluorescence measurement can only tell the variation of the average chloride level (increase, decrease, and no significant change) in certain conditions. The current methods significantly hinder the identification of deactivated cell pathways or protein based on the chloride level measurement. The proposed research integrate organelle selective dual reporters, single organelle measurement, subcellular imaging, and the three-dimensional analysis, to fingerprint the chemotype of organelles along with STING pathway, autophagy, and mitochondrial respiration. Completion of the proposed study will find out the physiological role of organellar chloride which shed light on the chloride channel-targeted therapy. The development of the organelle chemotype fingerprinting technique will also provide tools to characterize chloride channels, evaluate chloride channel modulators and identify the deactivated cell pathways or proteins.",5,5R35GM147112-03,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,8,7,0,0

Advances in DNA genotyping and sequencing technologies have led to the identification of >300 germline variants that contribute to breast cancer risk. However, as of today, large 'omics' studies include women of mostly European ancestry even though preliminary evidence indicates that there is a clear benefit in studying genetically diverse samples. A genome wide association study (genome wide association study) in Hispanic/Latina (Hispanic/Latina) women with one tenth of the number of individuals included in previous studies led to the discovery of protective variants only present in populations that have Indigenous American ancestry. These variants significantly add to the predictive accuracy of breast cancer polygenic risk scores (polygenic risk scores). Hispanic/Latina represent 16% of the U.S. population and in some states, up to 37%. To address the lack of Hispanic/Latina representation in genomics studies, we have created the Latin America genomics of breast cancer (Latin America genomics of breast cancer) consortium, which includes ~28,500 Latin American breast cancer patients and ~32,600 unaffected women from 11 different countries and the U.S. diaspora. Our goal is to study the Latin American-specific genetic architecture of breast cancer and develop predictive models that account for variation by ancestry and geography. By combining existing studies, Latin America genomics of breast cancer quadruples the prior Hispanic/Latina BC genome wide association study sample size and consequently, provides the power required for the discovery of additional variants contributing to breast cancer risk and for improving the predictive power of polygenic risk scores for risk stratification in those populations. In the first aim, we propose to discover susceptibility loci and genes associated with breast cancer in Hispanic/Latinas by conducting genome wide association study and ancestry-matched multi-tissue model-based transcriptome wide association studies with readily available RNA sequence data (transcriptome wide association studies with readily available RNA sequence data). These analyses will be repeated for overall risk and subtype-specific risk. In the second aim, we will use known and new genetic risk variants to improve breast cancer risk prediction using ancestry-aware approaches and integrating existing models based on non-genetic risk factors. This work is expected to result in the discovery of new risk variants that are especially relevant to populations with an admixed Indigenous American ancestral background. In addition, utilizing ancestry-matched and multi-tissue models for TWAS, new associations linked to ancestryspecific and tissue-specific eQTLs are expected to be uncovered.

Here, we aim to create essential preclinical data to characterize a novel genetic vaccine platform called PARVAX to increase its clinical acceptance. Our previous studies show that a single dose of PARVAX candidates for COVID-19 elicits sustained humoral immunity, near-sterilizing upper and lower airway protection from a SARS-CoV-2 challenge, and potent and durable cellular responses. These qualities combined with established commercial and low-cost manufacturing processes, make this platform imminently feasible, scalable and affordable for vaccine applications. In this proposal, we will investigate the mechanism behind the potency and durability of PARVAX, which we hypothesize is correlated with antigen expression kinetics (Aim 1). We also use rational engineering approaches to enhance the potency of the PARVAX platform, which will enhance safety and applicability for other pathogens (Aim 2). Finally, we propose to generate proof of the potency of PARVAX as a vaccine platform beyond COVID-19 by exploring the serum and mucosal immunity and protection from influenza viruses in two preclinical models of influenza infection (Aim 3). The proposed work is highly relevant for pandemic preparedness, since it will enable the rapid design of new and preclinically derisked PARVAX candidates for existing and future pathogens, and has the potential to provide clarity on the means to improve the durability, breadth and mucosal immunity of other platforms.",1,1R01AI179898-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3
10996727,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/8joQny5c6E2xf5qcSz6C2A/project-details/10996727#similar-Projects,ProAgio in Pancreatic Cancer,"ABSTRACT Cancer associated fibroblasts and pancreatic stellate cells (PSC/CAF) and abnormal tumor blood vessels are two major factors that contribute to treatment failure. PSC/CAF contribute to the collagen-rich extracellular matrix (extracellular matrix) which impairs drug delivery, promotes cancer cell survival and contributes to an immunosuppressive environment. CAF have been shown to have a similar role in supporting metastatic sites of disease in PDAC. Currently, no agent is available that can simultaneously selectively reduce activated PSC/CAF and normalize angiogenesis. Both activated PSC/CAF and angiogenic endothelial cells selectively express high levels of integrin v3. There is no expression of integrin v3 in normal tissue. We developed ProAgio, an innovative protein drug with a distinct mechanism of action from currently available integrin-targeting agents in targeting integrin v3 at a novel non-ligand binding site. ProAgio induces apoptosis of integrin v3 expressing PSC/CAF and angiogenic endothelial cells with a high efficiency by recruiting and activating caspase-8 at the cytoplasmic domain of. Our preliminary data shows ProAgio has anti-tumor activity in multiple PDAC models and enhances the effect of gemcitabine. Histologic analyses showed ProAgio decreased collagen and depleted PSC/CAF in tumors. In a phase I clinical trial, single agent ProAgio has demonstrated excellent safety profile, promising pharmacokinetic profile and anti-tumor activity in patients with PDAC. We hypothesize that, by inducing apoptosis of integrin v3 expressing cells, ProAgio will specifically deplete both angiogenic endothelial cells and activated PSC/CAF leading to inhibition of collagen deposition in PDAC tumors, which will enhance drug delivery and increase the sensitivity of PDAC to established therapies. This Project has three Specific Aims: 1) To characterize the toxicity and determine the recommended phase II dose of ProAgio in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. We will conduct a phase I clinical trial of ProAgio in metastatic PDAC patients with no prior therapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. The goal is to determine the recommended phase II dose, evaluate pharmacokinetics of ProAgio, and characterize toxicity. A secondary objective is to obtain preliminary activity data (overall response rate) for ProAgio with gemcitabine and nabpaclitaxel in PDAC. 2) To analyze the effect of ProAgio in patient tumors and validate the mechanism of drug action. PDAC patients enrolled in the expansion phase will undergo paired preand post-treatment biopsies. We will validate mechanism of ProAgio action by assessing changes in intratumoral collagen, blood vessels, PSC/CAF subtypes, immune cells, and αvβ3 expression in these patient samples. Samples will be analyzed via multiplex immunofluorescence with spatial quantification and single cell RNA sequencing. 3) To evaluate the pharmacodynamics effects of ProAgio on angiogenesis and tumor perfusion. The perfusion changes in tumors after treatment with ProAgio plus chemotherapy will be measured using quantitative DCE-MRI in all patients.",1,1R01CA294647-01,PAR-21-033,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Altered processing of social reward is common across several atypical developmental contexts, including among infants of depressed mothers and children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (autism spectrum disorders). This reduced sensitivity to social reward may disrupt infants' attention to caregivers and contribute to poorer learning outcomes associated with maternal depression and autism spectrum disorders. To understand how attention mechanisms become disrupted in atypical development it is necessary to characterize their normative development. Two distinct attention mechanisms, attention orienting (shifting attention to select information) and attention holding (maintaining attention to process information), function together to shape early learning. However, past research linking caregiving experiences (i.e., social-motivational factors) to developing attention has only examined infants' attention holding biases to caregivers without also examining orienting. Adults show robust orienting biases to motivationally salient stimuli, but research investigating early attention orienting has not addressed social-motivational factors and instead emphasizes mechanisms based on perceptual salience and endogenous control. As a result, the role of socialmotivational factors in the typical development of infants' attention orienting is unknown. The proposed research will investigate the development and predictors of infants' attention biases to caregivers and strangers who engage in salient caregiving behaviors. Study 1 will use eye tracking to longitudinally characterize within-subject changes in attention orienting and holding biases to caregiver vs. stranger faces from 4to 8-months of age (Aim 1). We will use additional measures of focused attention and behavioral coding of infant-caregiver interactions to determine the extent to which caregiving quality and endogenous attention control predict these changes in attention biases over time (Aim 2). Study 2 will determine the extent to which caregiving behaviors drive infants' attention beyond the familiarity of the social partner (Aim 3). Across four experiments, we will assess whether infants' preferential orienting generalizes to strangers who engage in caregiver-typical behaviors (i.e., appearing frequently, using infant-directed speech, responding contingently to their behavior). Research has extensively documented that early infant-caregiver interactions are critically important for social-emotional development, but we know far less about how these experiences influence developing cognitive skills. By characterizing the development of infants' attention biases to caregivers and identifying predictors of individual variance in these biases, this work will ultimately promote our understanding of mechanisms that link social reward processing to infants' early attention to and learning from caregivers in typical and atypical development.",5,5R01HD108325-02,PA-20-185,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,0,1,8,2

Secreted toxins are largely responsible for disease development, yet many aspects of C. difficile physiology and virulence remain poorly understood. Recent work has revealed that C. difficile produces two colony morphotypes-a rough colony variant and a smooth colony variant-and can reversibly switch them. This phenomenon is conserved among diverse C. difficile strains. The two morphological variants differ in several ways. Bacteria from rough colonies are longer and often found in chains, exhibit greater surface motility and diminished swimming motility, produce less biofilm biomass, and show greater pathogenicity in animal models compared to the smooth colony counterpart. Our prior work linked colony morphology and the correlated phenotypes to the expression of genes encoding a signal transduction system, CmrRST, but the molecular mechanisms by which C. difficile develops rough and smooth colony morphologies have yet to be defined. The objective of this study is to identify genes required for formation of each colony morphotype and to determine the roles of these genes in cell morphology, motility, biofilm formation, and virulence. In Aim 1, we propose three complementary yet independent mutagenesis and screening strategies to identify genes required for rough and smooth colony development. This work takes advantage of mutants designed to yield only one colony morphotype. The in vitro phenotypes of the mutants obtained through the genetic screens will be evaluated to determine the broader impact of the identified genes on C. difficile physiology and virulence traits. In Aim 2, we will examine how one identified mutation results in strictly rough colonies and assess its ability to colonize and cause disease in a mouse model of C. difficile infection. Similar strategies will be used to characterize additional mutants obtained in Aim 1. Pilot studies with the proposed approaches have identified multiple candidate genes predicted to affect cell division. As such, these gene products may serve as new targets for therapeutic development, yet almost none of these genes have been previously studied. The proposed research will identify factors contributing to disease relevant phenotypes including cell division proteins, facilitating efforts to combat C. difficile infection.",1,1R21AI186221-01,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

Rates in Africa are on the rise, but essential histopathology services critical for cancer care are scarce. To address this barrier, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML)-based computational pipeline (SIVQ/VIPR) that performs automated pixel-level image segmentation and classification from digital images of routinely collected hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides. SIVQ/VIPR is highly precise, reproducible, and outperforms subject matter experts. Once histologically distinct regions are identified, image analysis algorithms can then identify individual regions and aggregate them to predict diagnostic and prognostic features in conjunction with clinical outcomes to guide treatment. Our overall approach is to leverage our validated SIVQ/VIPR computational pipeline to develop and validate an AI-based diagnostic decision support (AI-based diagnostic decision support) tool for Colorectal cancer diagnosis and prognosis in an existing Kenyan cohort. To carry out this work, the Aga Khan University (AKU)- East Africa and the University of Michigan have partnered with Tenwek Hospital, a non-academic community-based public hospital in rural Bomet, Kenya, to develop a unique collaboration of oncologists, pathologists, surgeons, statisticians, and informaticians, making us uniquely suited to develop population-relevant, affordable, and scalable data science solutions in Kenya - all priorities of the DS-I Africa Program. We will: Aim 1. Adapt and validate an existing ML-based diagnostic algorithm for Colorectal cancer using digital fields of view from H&E-stained slides in a retrospective cohort of n=675 Colorectal cancer cases from the AKU and Tenwek Hospitals. We will apply the Colorectal cancer-trained SIVQ/VIPR computational pipeline for segmentation and classification for Colorectal cancer features, followed by a confirmatory classifier step to achieve a case level, binary result of a cancer/no-cancer (i.e., diagnosis). Aim 2. Develop and refine an unsupervised ML method to identify histopathology image-derived measurements associated with Colorectal cancer prognosis. We will use computer/machine vision approaches to identify image features (e.g., cellular morphology) discriminative of Colorectal cancer prognosis and biological potential for disease aggressiveness. Combined use of AI-based morphological signatures of aggressive disease (e.g., high-grade tumor architecture) will be compiled with other clinically relevant features towards the goal of generating a multi-axial multiplexed AI-based diagnostic decision support tool that can maximally inform of the biological and metastatic potential of each Colorectal cancer case. This project will lay the groundwork for an AI-based diagnostic decision support tool for clinicians (e.g., pathologists, oncologists) that facilitates prompt and accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and risk stratification for Colorectal cancer care in Africa. Because this approach leverages open-source software and can be deployed as a turn-key system intended for web-based cloud deployment, it is well-suited for capacity building, integrating into educational programs, and expanding to other emergent or prevalent cancers (i.e., breast, cervical, prostate) as part of the DS-I Africa Consortium.",5,5U01CA287852-02,RFA-RM-22-023,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,17,8,4,4

Moreover, protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 was identified as a major influence on microbiome composition across multiple patient cohorts.In mice constitutively lacking Ptpn2, we identified substantial changes in gut microbiota populations highlighted by increased abundance of a novel mouse adherent-invasive E. coli (adherent-invasive E. coli). This mouse adherent-invasive E. coli was able to colonize mouse intestine, exacerbate colitis onset, and delay recovery from colitis. Moreover, we now report that protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 loss compromises Paneth cells which have critical roles in preserving intestinal mucosal-microbial homeostasis. We also identify that epithelial protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 deletion reduces Paneth cell antimicrobial peptide expression, and increases susceptibility to pathogen infection. Thus, we hypothesize that protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 serves as a ""microbial modulator"" by regulating innate defense mechanisms of epithelial cells to protect the intestine against bacterial 'dysbiosis', including expansion of, and colonization with, the disease-relevant pathobiont, adherent-invasive E. coli. The goals of this proposal are to determine how loss of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 activity disrupts i) Paneth cell antimicrobial properties; and ii) how does protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 regulate other (non-Paneth cell) features of epithelial antimicrobial defense and intracellular bacterial handling. Expected Outcomes & Impact: This proposal will increase our broader understanding of the molecular basis by which host factors preserve the intestinal barrier and microbial homeostasis, and lead to development of new approaches and targets to restore host-microbe relationships in diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease.",5,5R01DK091281-10,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,3,4,1,3

In comparison to left ventricular failure (RVF, right ventricular failure (RVF is understudied with the important consequence that no RV-specific therapies exist. Computational multi-scale modeling offers a unique opportunity to integrate dysfunction manifest at multiple scales: at the organelle level, there are impairments of mitochondria, Ca2+- handling, and myofilament function; at the tissue level, there is myocyte necrosis, apoptosis, fibrosis and capillary rarefaction; at the organ level, hypertrophy and dilation; and at the organism level, exercise intolerance. Moreover, computational modeling is ideally suited to answering the question: what are the relative contributions from abnormalities at multiple scales to the overall phenotype of right ventricular failure (RVF? We propose to answer this question with a data-driven, multiscale, computational modeling approach. Beginning with an existing mitochondrial kinetic computational model fit to healthy and right ventricular failure (RVF mitochondrial function, we will predict the emergence of dysfunction at the tissue-level. Then, fitting a myocardial tissue computational model to healthy and right ventricular failure (RVF passive and active mechanics, we will predict emergence of dysfunction at the organ-level. Finally, by adapting an existing biventricular mechanics computational model to healthy and right ventricular failure (RVF pressure-volume dynamics, we will predict the emergence of dysfunction at the organism-level, i.e., exercise intolerance. Model assumptions and predictions will be driven-by and tested against experimental data collected using state-of-the-art techniques at the organelle-, tissue-, organ-, and organism-scales at multiple time points in an established rat model of right ventricular failure (RVF. Finally, we will use our data-driven computational modeling approach to confirm the human disease relevance of mechanisms of right ventricular failure (RVF found in rodent using our state-of-theart experimental techniques on human failing and nonfailing myocardium. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Determine the drivers of systolic dysfunction in right ventricular failure (RVF. We hypothesize that the major driver of systolic dysfunction in right ventricular failure (RVF is impaired mitochondrial generation of ATP leading to impaired contraction of cardiac myofilaments. We will test this hypothesis with scale-specific models and multi-scale experimental data collected from rats with right ventricular failure (RVF. Aim 2: Determine the drivers of diastolic dysfunction in right ventricular failure (RVF. We hypothesize that diastolic dysfunction in right ventricular failure (RVF is driven by fibrosis and impaired myofilament relaxation. We will test this hypothesis with scale-specific models and multi-scale experimental data collected from rats with right ventricular failure (RVF. Aim 3: Determine the drivers of systolic and diastolic function in human right ventricular failure (RVF. Key predictions of organelleand tissue-scale structural and functional drivers of right ventricular failure (RVF will be tested with multiscale modeling validated with state-of-the-art measurements at these scales in non-failing and failing human heart tissues.",5,5R01HL154624-05,PA-19-056,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,2,0,0

Due to immune-mediated destruction of the insulinproducing  cells, treatment of Type 1 diabetes is limited to daily exogenous insulin administration. Needed are immunotherapies that effectively suppress  cell autoimmunity longterm in order to prevent and treat Type 1 diabetes. One approach is the administration of cell autoantigens to induce differentiation of adaptive regulatory CD4+ T cells (adaptive regulatory CD4+ T cells). The approach is appealing since autoimmunity can be selectively targeted while leaving acquired immunity unperturbed. A major hurdle, however, is inducing a sufficiently sized and subset diverse adaptive regulatory CD4+ T cells pool, while avoiding expansion of pathogenic effector T cells (Teff). The size and nature of the adaptive regulatory CD4+ T cells pool is particularly important at late preclinical Type 1 diabetes stages and at the onset of clinical diabetes, when a high frequency of diabetogenic CD4+ and CD8+ Teff is found. This R21 outlines a novel approach to enhance the efficacy of antigen therapy by ""tuning"" the function of CD4. CD4 binding to MHCII activates a signaling cascade that contributes to overall TCR signaling strength. We hypothesize that modulating CD4 function and TCR signaling strength, results in increased and selective induction of adaptive regulatory CD4+ T cells by antigen vaccination. In our model, differentiation of adaptive regulatory CD4+ T cells subsets is determined by varying the level of coreceptor tuning (coreceptor tuning). We will employ nondepleting CD4 antibody to achieve coreceptor tuning. Key objectives of this R21 are to gain initial insight into the mechanism(s) by which coreceptor tuning selectively promotes adaptive regulatory CD4+ T cells differentiation (Aim 1), and determine the therapeutic efficacy of this combinatorial approach (Aim 2). If successful, combined coreceptor tuning and self-antigen vaccination is expected to be applicable not only for the prevention and treatment of Type 1 diabetes, but also for other T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases and pathologies.",5,5R21AI166876-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,12,4,0,0

The practical application of P450 research to drug metabolism has been a notable highlight in the pharmaceutical industry in the past three decades. Many of the leaders in this field have trained in this laboratory. Variations in P450s are issues in drug-drug interactions, endocrine diseases, cancer, and other medical problems. Despite some success using directed evolution and protein engineering, there is still much room for improvement in the development of P450s as biocatalysts. In this proposal, I plan to address several important questions about human P450 enzymes, including both microsomal and mitochondrial P450s: Is the Compound I intermediate (FeO3+) the only oxidant involved in P450 reactions, including steroid C-C bond cleavages? What are the physiological roles of the remaining human P450 orphans (i.e., the P450s that do not presently have a clear function)? What is the physiological relevance of P450 27C1 in human skin-we know the reactions catalyzed by this enzyme but we do not know the function. What are the roles of other binding proteins (other than for retinoids) in P450 oxidations of lipophilic physiological compounds? What is the molecular basis of P450 17A1-cytochrome b5 interactions and is there a potential for developing drugs for prostate cancer? Techniques to be used include organic synthesis, spectroscopy, enzyme kinetics, mass spectrometry, proteomics, X-ray crystallography, and cell and molecular biology.

While radiotherapy is still one of the most effective treatment options for glioblastoma, it cannot control the disease over time. This suggests that novel combination therapies are desperately needed to improve radiation treatment outcome for patients suffering from this disease. The studies outlined in this proposal are based on a hypothesis that is backed by our extensive preliminary data and rigorous published data in the literature. The overall hypothesis is that biomarker-based drug selection predicts synergistic lethality of combination therapies in GICs and glioblastoma bulk tumor cell populations, prevents radiation-induced GBM phenotype conversion and allows for individualized optimization of radiotherapy. The three aims of this study will address this aspect of glioma biology using an innovative tool to track GICs and their progeny, while leveraging the unique resources and expertise available at UCLA and the NIH/NCI CTEP portfolio of drugs. Aim 1 will identify compounds in the NCI CTEP portfolio that interfere with radiation-induced phenotype conversion in glioblastoma and develop biomarker profiles predictive of synergistic lethality in combination with radiation.

In this R35 MIRA proposal, I outline my research program consisting of two complementary research directions aimed at expanding the scope of methodologies for chemical probe development toward underexplored biological targets and, ultimately, accelerating drug discovery. Research A is focused on improving the throughput of medicinal chemistry by expanding our first-of-its-kind high-throughput medicinal chemistry (high-throughput medicinal chemistry) platform, which is based on Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange) click-chemistry reactions. Although I previously demonstrated successful application of my high-throughput medicinal chemistry platform to several well-characterized model proteins, additional work is needed to enable targeting of underexplored proteins, including those that lack distinct binding sites. In this research, we will address the challenge of developing chemical probes against underexplored proteins by coupling our platform with a covalent ligand approach, both at the target protein level (A1) and in a proteome-wide manner (A2). Successful completion of this work will expand the biological targets accessible to our high-throughput medicinal chemistry workflow, thereby accelerating probe development against underexplored proteins and enabling elucidation of their biological functions and roles in human health and disease. In Research B, we will develop strategies for synthesis and evaluation of subcellular location selective-probes. Modulation of small molecule subcellular distribution, introduced by Christian de Duve in the 1970s, remains a promising yet underexplored strategy in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry, largely due to the technical challenge of developing subcellular-selective chemical probes. Our long-term goal is to establish a comprehensive medicinal chemistry workflow to develop subcellular-selective probes and drugs. In this grant period, we will develop a Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange-enabled method for extracellular-selective chemical probe synthesis (B1), demonstrate approaches to assess organelle-selective target engagement (B2), and explore the potential of modulating organelle selectivity as a medicinal chemistry strategy to improve cellular potency (B3). Development of chemical probes with subcellular resolution will overcome a longstanding hurdle in medicinal chemistry and provide crucial insights into spatio-specific protein functions in disease mechanisms. In total, the workflows and approaches that result from the proposed research program will accelerate and expand the scope of chemical probe development in a proteome-wide and spatio-defined manner, fundamentally advancing the fields of chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. Application of the developed technologies and chemical probes will enhance our understanding of living systems and provide proof-of-concept for novel therapeutic mechanisms of action to support drug development efforts.",1,1R35GM155249-01,PAR-23-145,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

Despite the utility of existing neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, there is an urgent need to develop cost-effective and blood-based biomarkers to apply at the population level. Large-scale multi-omics studies identified a multitude of molecular perturbations in Alzheimer's disease. These discoveries support the rationale for discovery of peripheral biomarkers that capture the full spectrum of central changes that occur in this disease. Our proposal aims to leverage combined blood and brain multi-omics data in well-characterized cohorts to identify peripheral molecular signatures which reflect the central molecular perturbations that occur in Alzheimer's disease brains. We hypothesize that blood molecular signatures can serve as centrallylinked peripheral biomarkers (centrallylinked peripheral biomarkers) since many brain multi-omics changes can also be observed in blood and vice versa. As they are linked with brain molecular perturbations, such centrallylinked peripheral biomarkers can provide mechanistic information on potential drivers of disease and its progression. centrallylinked peripheral biomarkers can also be expected to aid in patient stratification according to biological subtypes and disease stage, ultimately paving the way for personalized medicine. There are, however, no sizable studies that simultaneously analyze brain and blood samples from the same individuals to discover centrally-linked peripheral molecular signatures (centrally-linked peripheral molecular signatures) that can serve as future centrally-linked peripheral biomarkers (centrallylinked peripheral biomarkers). In Project 1, we leverage three studies with complementary strengths, Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Mayo Clinic Florida postmortem African American and Latino American cohorts, to accomplish our specific aims to: 1. Discover brain region-specific centrally-linked peripheral molecular signatures through molecular profiling (transcriptome, genome, methylome, proteome, metabolome/lipidome) in up to 5 brain regions and in matched blood samples. 2. Identify cell-type specific centrally-linked peripheral molecular signatures through single nucleus transcriptome profiling across 5 brain regions and in matched blood samples. 3. Establish centrally-linked peripheral molecular signatures in diverse populations by profiling of same -omics measures across the same brain regions from LA and AA participants. 4. Discover centrally-linked peripheral molecular signatures that reflect biological subtypes and temporal progression of Alzheimer's disease through use of advanced analytics approaches of the molecular data. We expect to identify brain region and cell-type specific centrally-linked peripheral molecular signatures, which reflect the heterogeneous neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease; associate with or drive antemortem clinical, neuroimaging and cognitive progression and outcomes of Alzheimer's disease; define biological subtypes and predict molecular stage of Alzheimer's disease in multi-ethnic populations.

Emerging products may be completely novel (i.e., a new form of nicotine delivery), a refinement of an existing product (e.g., a new cigarette variety; a redesign of vaping or heated tobacco product), or a product introduced into a new market (e.g., a Japanese HTP introduced in the US). The underlying goal of the Core is to centralize the production of data related to product sale, characteristics, features, and chemical composition that can then feed the projects within the P01, helping to improve research efficiency. This Core has two Specific Aims: Aim 1 is identify emerging tobacco and nicotine products. Using multiple modes and data sources (INPAM surveys, web scraping, social media rapid scans (e.g., Twitter), marketing reports (Nielsen and tobacco companies), stock analyst reports, Securities and Exchange Commission (Securities and Exchange Commission) filings, patents submitted by and granted to tobacco companies), we will identify and track emerging products, changes in sale/availability/prices of products, and changes in products (e.g., new versions) in each country. We will focus on those emerging products where evidence already exists of uptake, or products that have a strong likelihood of uptake among youth and/or long-term smokers based on social media `buzz,' test marketing, advertising, and changes in marketing or availability due to regulatory action. Aim 2 is to characterize design, labelling, contents, and emissions of emerging products by category and country. Our focus will be on emergent products identified in Aim 1 to determine, through physical and chemical analyses of the product, whether product design, chemical ingredients, emissions, and/or performance differs and potentially is calibrated to specific regulations and hence differ across jurisdictions with different policies. Results generated by the Emerging Products Core can help to develop survey items (Projects 1 and 2) to better adopt to the dynamically changing marketplace and provide context to experimental or modeling studies (Projects 3 and 4). The Emerging Products Core will make sure that information about products is current and data is consistent across projects. We also expect that this data will be useful to WHO, FDA, and other national and state regulators. Finally, we expect that data generated by Emerging Products Core will be useful to researchers outside of the P01 who can use this information to consider the impact of regulatory activities on product popularity and its characteristics.",5,5P01CA200512-09,PAR-20-077,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,6,5,8,2

New approaches to diagnose schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension are needed, as the current diagnostic criteria require invasive right heart catheterization leading to under and delayed diagnosis. An opportunity to develop noninvasive diagnostic risk scores for PAH is provided by the PVDomics dataset and a collaboration to conduct these analyses at UCSF using the PVDomics data has been established. The proposed studies will define diagnostic risk scores for PAH (i) using a broad range of clinical, echocardiographiccardiographic (echocardiographic), and biomarker predictors and (ii) using predictors easily measured in lowand middle-income countries (lowand middle-income countries). The risk scores would enable estimation of the probability of PAH in individuals, the PAH case-rate in clinic samples, and PAH prevalence in communities at risk. Regardless of lowand middle-income countries, the scores will rely only on noninvasive predictors to support their repeated use in disease screening. After developing the risk score, its first application to will be to schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension disease, and will take place in the longitudinal prospective cohorts we are enrolling at 3 clinical sites in Ethiopia and Zambia, targeting 40 enrollees per site per year. We will estimate the case-rate of schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension by standard of care criteria and using the Aim-1 diagnostic risk score. Eligible patients will have a history of Schistosoma infection and be diagnosed with schistosomiasis-associated hepatosplenic disease (schistosomiasis-associated hepatosplenic disease), placing them at relatively high risk for schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension. At baseline and annual follow-up study visits each participant will undergo clinical and echocardiographiccardiography assessments, and providing blood samples for biomarker assessments to ensure that the predictors on which the diagnostic score is based are on hand. Once it is defined, the risk score and probability of PAH will be calculated on each participants' data, both at past and future visits, and the distribution the quantities will be summarized graphically. This study also will evaluate some biomarkers that reflect the pathobiology of schistosomiasis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension and may be particularly suitable for identifying PAH disease during its preclinical and early clinical periods, which could suggest a role as potential therapeutic targets. We believe these diagnostic tools will have enormous impact on all those worldwide who are at risk for developing PAH or living with undiagnosed PAH.",5,5R21AI171968-02,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,8,2,0,0

However, little is known about how clinicians obtain information about innovations make decisions about implementation and de-implementation during uncertain times. As SARS-CoV-2 made its initial, rapid spread across the nation, clinicians feared that the impending surge of critically ill patients would overwhelm capacity, causing patient deaths due to a lack of ventilators and other essential resources. Additionally, shortages of personal protective equipment posed a challenge to following the usual standards to protect clinicians from infection. In a massive response to prevent worst-case scenarios from materializing, emergency department (emergency department) staff have rapidly innovated to deliver effective care, protect frontline workers, and ensure a sustainable supply of personal protective equipment. In response to these unusual conditions, emergency department clinicians turned to nontraditional sources of information-for example, Twitter, Facebook, podcasts, and preprint journal publications-to learn about innovations they could use to care for COVID-19 patients in emergency departments. While these sources of information provided easy access to information about innovations, they also spread misinformation. Little research has been done to optimize dissemination and implementation of innovations during a public health emergency. Before the pandemic, an expansion of online platforms facilitating exchange of information about innovations had already occurred, and many more exist now. Information is also shared through professional societies and also through social media. But the understanding of the diffusion of innovations among emergency departments during the pandemic is currently limited due to the volume of sharing that happened during COVID-19; the urgency and fear associated with these innovations; and the need for deimplementation of interventions that were found to be ineffective or even dangerous. It is not clear how these processed happened and whether they might have differed based on the demographics of emergency department clinicians or the communities and populations they serve. A comprehensive evaluation of the flow of innovations will lead to insights into how disseminators and implementers can improve practices during pandemic and rapidly evolving emergencies and also how processes can be optimized for more steady-state conditions. Our study incorporates a strong interdisciplinary and mixed methods approach. Our strong team will work with study partners representing emergency physicians and nurses and experts in other disciplines in the emergency department. Study methods combine advanced natural language processing techniques with interviews (Aim 1), focus groups with a survey of emergency department professionals (Aim 2), and systematic synthesis of results to identify strategies for improving diffusion of emergency department care innovations (Aim 3). The study will also provide results in actionable formats, such as a toolkit of dissemination and implementation strategies.",5,5R01AI169293-03,PAR-19-274,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,1,5,3,2

Although many causes of acute infection exist, a similar set of stereotyped symptoms occur, which includes increased body temperature or fever, decreased appetite and increased lethargy. Both warm-­ and cold-­blooded animals generate a fever in response infection suggesting that fever circuits are hard-­wired and highly conserved, yet exactly how the nervous system alters body temperature and associated behavior in response to infection remains unknown. We have identified a population of neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus that are highly activated following administration of inflammatory lipopolysaccharides (lipopolysaccharides). Due to the close proximity between the organum vasculosum of the laminae terminalis (organum vasculosum of the laminae terminalis), where inflammatory cytokines enter the brain to affect nearby cells, and neurons of the preotpic area regulating normal body temperature, and our preliminary data, we propose that these newly identified lipopolysaccharides-­sensitive neurons control fever initiation during an immune response. We will use chemogenetic activation and cell ablation approaches to demonstrate that this population plays a role in increasing body temperature and in affecting other fever-­associated behaviors upon lipopolysaccharides injection. Further, we have recently developed new approaches for molecular characterization of genetically defined cell populations in situ using single-­cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-­seq) and multiplex, error-­robust, fluorescent in situ hybridization (multiplex, error-­robust, fluorescent in situ hybridization) to generate a spatially-­resolved and functionally-­aware atlas of the preoptic area. We will apply a similar strategy to characterize fever-­inducing neurons as well as surrounding non-­ neuronal cell types that are likely to play a role in fever generation through paracrine mechanisms. Finally, we propose to use viral-­mediated tracing and functional tools to determine the direct and indirect circuit mechanisms by which lipopolysaccharides-­sensitive neurons and their targets exert control over body temperature and fever-­related behaviors. Our data will lead to a molecular and functional characterization of lipopolysaccharides-­sensitive neurons in the preoptic area and to a better understanding of how inflammatory sickness symptoms, such as fever and related behavioral changes, are regulated in the brain. These efforts have direct implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying human sickness, and may inform new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of fever and associated symptoms.",5,5R01NS112399-05,PA-19-056,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

Of the 3.8 million people living with HIV in the Americas, 2.8 million live in Latin America. The HIV epidemic continues to be highly concentrated among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), especially in Mesoamerican countries such as Guatemala (9%), Belize (13.9%), Mexico (14.9%) and El Salvador (16.3%). Research points to multiple co-occurring psychosocial and structural conditions, including HIVand sexuality-related stigmas that act as intertwined forces that potentiate HIV transmission among GBM. This study addresses intersectional stigmas experienced by Indigenous GBM (Indigenous GBM) in Guatemala. This study will adapt a patient-provider stigma-reduction intervention - Finding Respect and Ending Stigma around HIV (Finding Respect and Ending Stigma around HIV). Finding Respect and Ending Stigma around HIV is workshop-based intervention that has been employed to reduce stigmas among healthcare workers and GBM around the world, including a recent Spanish-language version in the Dominican Republic. Guatemala is a diverse society in which close to 50% of the population identifies as Indigenous. Indigenous Guatemalans who also identify as GBM, experience intersectional stigmas, including racial discrimination, which increase vulnerability to HIV. Due to a crumbling public health system, and discrimination towards Indigenous people at public hospitals, Indigenous traditional healers (Indigenous traditional healers) are the first line of response to those seeking health services. The adapted Finding Respect and Ending Stigma around HIV intervention, named KABAWIL in Maya K'iche language will be implemented with Indigenous GBM and will include, for the first time, Indigenous traditional healers. Our aims include: Aim 1: We will use the ADAPTITT framework to adapt Finding Respect and Ending Stigma around HIV and produce the culturally tailored KABAWIL intervention. We will conduct indepth interviews (20 per group) and two focus groups with Indigenous GBM and Indigenous traditional healers. Aim 2: We will use a randomized waitlist control trial design to pilot test the intervention with 120 participants. Thirty Indigenous GBM and 30 Indigenous traditional healers will be randomly assigned to three KABAWIL intervention workshops (10 GBM + 10 Indigenous traditional healers per workshop; n=60). The other 30 GBM and 30 Indigenous traditional healers will be assigned to the 3-month wait-list control. We will assess the intervention's preliminary efficacy on increasing HIV testing, PrEP uptake, PrEP/ART adherence, and decreasing experiences of stigma and discrimination. Aim 3: Evaluate facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the KABAWIL intervention. We will conduct a post-implementation, mixed-methods assessment guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research). We will conduct interviews with Indigenous GBM (n=10), Indigenous traditional healers (n=10), and interventionists (n=10) to identify contextual and organizational factors that may impact the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and determine organizational/contextual fit for the design of a larger hybrid effectiveness implementation trial to establish KABAWIL as a model for reducing intersectional stigmas and improve HIV prevention and care for indigenous people throughout the Americas.",1,1R01TW012904-01,PAR-23-190,FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER,6,5,3,2
10842703,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/UADjff92OEar12DHfuL1Sw/project-details/10842703#similar-Projects,Proteostasis signaling in cell cycle control,"ABSTRACT Dynamic oscillations in protein abundance represents the most salient molecular feature of cell cycle progression. This is typified by the cyclins and cyclin kinase inhibitors (cyclin kinase inhibitors), that oscillate during cell cycle progression and determine the activation kinetics of Cyclin Dependent Kinases, which propel the cell cycle forward. Protein dynamics are not confined to kinase regulators, but rather are exhibited by hundreds of proteins, including regulators of transcription, chromatin organization, cytoskeleton, and metabolism. Defining the pathways, networks and mechanisms underlying these dynamics is essential to understanding proliferative control. Cell cycle protein dynamics are controlled, in part, by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Ubiquitin is the major regulator of protein degradation in eukaryotes and plays an essential and highly conserved role in cell cycle. A cascade of enzymes coordinates the conjugation of ubiquitin onto substrates. However, E3 ligases are the enzymes that ultimately determine when, where and who is ubiquitinated. Like other post-translational modifications, ubiquitin is reversible, and can be removed from substrates by deubiquitinases (deubiquitinases). Thus, the countervailing activities of E3s and deubiquitinases sculpts the proteome to regulate cell cycle progression and the maintenance of genome integrity. The goal of my research is to define enzymes in the ubiquitin pathway that control cell cycle, their cognate substrates, and how specific ubiquitination events contribute to cell cycle progression. To address this goal, the proposed project seeks to address two fundamental questions, which remain understudied. The first relates to key molecular events of G2-phase. Cells arrest in G2 in response to stress and damage and utilize this time to make key decisions about whether to proliferate. However, G2 remains the most poorly studied phase in the cell cycle. We uncovered a widespread program of protein degradation that occurs in G2 and G2/M, and which is regulated by the activity of the multi-functional kinase PLK1. The identity and timing of substrate degradation, the E3 ligases involved, and the consequences of this regulation are almost entirely unstudied. The second question relates to the role of deubiquitinases in cell cycle, which relative to the E3s they antagonize, remain vastly understudied. Using computational and proteomic methods we identified deubiquitinases with understudied roles in cell cycle. We are determining their enzyme kinetics and preferences, substrates, mechanisms of action, and structures when bound to E3 counterparts. We pursue these questions using a combination of cell, molecular and biochemical assays, combined with proteomics and cryo-electron microscopy. Collectively, addressing these questions will identify new regulatory pathways that control cell cycle, proliferative decision making, and the maintenance of genome integrity.",1,1R35GM153250-01,PAR-22-180,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

However, small molecules are still imperfect tools for influencing human physiology. The chemical space that our known drugs occupy is extremely small, representing a tiny sliver of the estimated 10^63 possible drug-like molecules. What's more, the targets of these drugs make up just about 3.5% of the roughly 20,000 proteins in the human proteome. This means almost 97% of the proteome is still untouched for drug intervention. These two factors suggest there's immense potential for discovering novel chemical structures to combat disease. However, systematically exploring such enormous chemical spaces is physically unachievable. To synthesize even milligram scale representations of this chemical space would result in a mass surpassing that of the known universe. This practical obstacle partly explains why only a small portion of the proteins in the proteome have been pharmacologically targeted. To overcome this diversity enumeration hurdle, we aim to introduce a completely new class of molecules capable of spontaneously ""shape shifting"" at physiological temperature. This unique ability will allow them to assume a wide array of rapidly interchanging structural isomers, essentially behaving like many molecules in one. We plan to demonstrate this technology through the development of synthetic bullvalene amino acids that can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methodologies for combinatorial solid phase peptide synthesis to create shape shifting cyclic peptides (shape shifting cyclic peptides). Our ultimate goal is to create a dynamic and adaptable library that far outpaces any known library in terms of diversity. We aim to utilize this technology to identify single molecular entities that display multitarget pharmacological properties.",1,1R21GM154148-01,PAR-22-126,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

Candida albicans is one of the most pervasive fungal pathogens, killing almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult, as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease. We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful functional genomics resource that we are uniquely positioned to expand to allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome. This resource includes a collection of conditional expression strains that covers ~40% of the genome where one allele of a target gene is deleted in the diploid pathogen, and expression of the remaining wild-type allele is governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. During the prior funding period we: developed a pipeline to expand the resource to genome scale, optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing with pooled assays to quantify the relative proportion of each strain, which are uniquely marked with molecular barcodes; optimized high-resolution image analysis of cellular morphology and structures; and developed assays for identifying genes important for commensalism, virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our efficient high-throughput analyses established the power of systematic genetic analysis to uncover new biological insights that could not have been predicted based on current paradigms and enabled focused, hypothesis-driven dissection of key mechanisms governing hostpathogen interactions. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis, commensalism, and virulence, and will reveal fundamental biological mechanisms that could not be predicted without a systematic genetic approach. Our studies will: 1) complete the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to cover non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into host adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. Our comprehensive strain resources and compendium of phenotypic profiles will be made available to the community, advancing the field with a publicly accessible database and interpretive machine learning model to maximize insight. This work will provide the most comprehensive functional genomics resource for any fungal pathogen and will reveal genes governing host adaptation, revealing new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens.",5,5R01AI127375-07,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

Recent studies have provided snapshots of GPCR structures in distinct conformations and revealed that they are extremely dynamic. The conformational dynamics appear to be central to ligand recognition, activation and signaling. Membrane receptors have evolved to respond to precise spatio-temporal concentration profiles of extracellular ligands. In the nervous system, neurotransmitter receptors encounter a wide range of neurotransmitter concentrations and spatio-temporal profiles. Key factors are the small extracellular volume of the synaptic cleft, pumps and/or enzymes that remove neurotransmitter, and diffusion. Additionally, neurotransmitter receptors can be localized within the synapse both preand postsynaptically, as well as extrasynaptically where they can encounter neurotransmitter released either locally, which briefly reaches low millimolar levels within the cleft, and spillover from nearby synapses, which reaches lower concentrations. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (Metabotropic glutamate receptors) are found preand postsynaptically at excitatory glutamatergic synapses, as well as on glia and at inhibitory GABAergic presynaptic nerve terminals, meaning that they are activated by both high local concentrations near the site of release and spillover. Metabotropic glutamate receptors of various kinds can be found together in presynaptic nerve terminals, even when they are all coupled to the same G protein. And they can dimerize, generating hybrid or in some cases totally unique properties and pharmacological profiles. To understand what each mGluR subtype does and develop effective drugs to treat the neurological disorders in which they are implicated, we need to understand how they function and how they are regulated. Our goal here is to define the molecular mechanisms that set and regulate the functional properties of homoand heteromeric Metabotropic glutamate receptors at synapses and put into place assays that can be used to screen modulation in the nervous system.",5,5R01NS119826-04,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,5,13,5,0

It is possible today to sequence an entire human genome in roughly one day; however, bioinformatic analysis typically takes days or weeks, and has emerged as the major bottleneck for successfully utilizing genome sequencing in time-critical applications, e.g. for identifying the genomic vulnerabilities of a patient's tumor for rational cancer treatment selection within a clinically relevant timeframe. The overarching goal of this proposal is to dramatically speed up genomic analysis algorithms via heterogeneous computing techniques. Here we will focus on one critical aspect of genomic analysis, i.e. variant calling, and set the ambitious goal of completing the analysis of a 60X-coverage Illumina whole genome sequencing dataset in under 10 minutes, far faster than the current state of the art. Although here applied to only one analysis task, accomplishing such a high degree of acceleration would demonstrate that the techniques we are developing in this proposal are also generalizable across many other genomic analysis tasks. Our approach is to first accelerate the most widely reusable software components, to maximize value for the genomic analysis tool developer community, who will then be able to integrate these components into their own tools. With these reusable software components, we will accelerate the FreeBayes variant caller tool. FreeBayes is a widely used germline variant and somatic mutation detection tool, and therefore acceleration will benefit a large user audience. This software was developed in our own laboratory, and therefore we are intimately familiar with its algorithms and code base, positioning us for success in this exploratory project. If successful, our technique will be applicable for accelerating many, currently time-consuming analysis tasks. As a result, analysts will be able to finish sophisticated data processing tasks within minutes, as part of their interactive analysis session rather than a batched background process, and complete manual result review immediately after; rendering the complete analysis process sufficiently fast for time-critical clinical applications.",5,5R21CA271098-02,PAR-22-090,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,11,8,7,0

Dysfunction of the cortical areas controlling these behaviors is a common cause of disability. Basic neuroscience research on the underlying circuits can help to identify pathophysiological mechanisms and ultimately inform treatments of these disorders. Our prior progress has advanced basic knowledge about the synaptic circuit organization of the forelimb-related primary motor cortex (M1) in the mouse, including local circuits, cortico-thalamo-cortical loops, and input pathways from forelimb-related primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and other parietal areas. We now propose to address a major remaining gap in knowledge: the cellular/synaptic basis for inter-areal communication in premotor→motor pathways. These appear important for coordinating the functions associated with premotor areas (e.g. motor planning) with those of primary motor areas (e.g. movement execution), in the context of predicted and actual sensory feedback. Premotor→M1 axonal projections are anatomically prominent, but the underlying corticocortical circuits are only partly characterized. Both M2 and S1 feed into M1, but the behavioral functions of these afferent streams are profoundly different, with S1 conveying bottom-up somatosensory information reporting ongoing changes in the sensory environment, and M2 providing top-down signals related to action planning and sensorimotor prediction. We therefore hypothesize that the M2→M1 circuits and S1→M1 circuits are also asymmetrically implemented, reflecting the asymmetric behavior-related computations they support. We speculate that M2→M1 circuits are configured through cell-type-specific connections and synaptic dynamics to provide M2 with relatively more direct influence on M1 output neurons. Using the mouse as model organism for genetically accessing specific cell types together with viral labeling methods, we will apply electrophysiological and optogenetic methods to characterize circuits linking the forelimbrelated secondary motor cortex (M2; rostral forelimb area) to forelimb M1 (characterize circuits linking the forelimbrelated secondary motor cortex (M2; rostral forelimb area) to forelimb M1). Additionally, we will investigate how top-down projections from M2 integrate in M1 with bottom-up inputs from S1. Our strategy is two-pronged: in a series of slice-based experiments (Aim 1) we will use in vivo labeling methods combined with ex vivo brain slice optogenetics and whole-cell recordings to characterize monoand polysynaptic M2→M1 circuits. In a series of in vivo experiments (Aim 2), we will use linear-array electrophysiological recordings of cortical spiking activity in the awake mouse, at rest and during natural forelimb movements, combined with optogenetic manipulations of M2 input to assess in dynamics in M2→M1 circuits. Overall, we expect our findings to be broadly significant for their relevance to current concepts about hierarchical cortical networks and corticocortical signaling in general, as well as for advancing basic knowledge about motor cortex circuit organization and the mechanistic basis for premotor→motor communication.",2,2R37NS061963-16A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,0,1,5,1

From 2010 to 2019, the number of new HIV infections in Latin America increased 21%, compared to a global reduction of 23%. The number of reported HIV cases in Brazil increased from 13,719 in 2011 to 40,880 in 2021, with increases driven by sexual and gender minority youth aged 15-24 years (sexual and gender minority youth aged 15-24 years). Among men aged 15-24 years, HIV incidence per 100,000 increased from 37.8 in 2000 to 66.5 in 2018 - a 75% increase. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (pre-exposure prophylaxis) was approved in Brazil in 2021 for adolescents aged 15-17 years, but pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake has been <1% among sexual and gender minority youth aged 15-24 years. Our team conducted the first and largest pre-exposure prophylaxis demonstration study among adolescents in Latin America (pre-exposure prophylaxis1519), in which we implemented peer navigation strategies that linked 1174 sexual and gender minority youth aged 15-24 years (20% of 5870 recruited) to pre-exposure prophylaxis services at SGM-affirming health facilities. In qualitative interviews, sexual and gender minority youth aged 15-24 years articulated positive relationships with peer navigators but reluctance to engage with facility-based services due to past experiences with stigma and logistical and structural challenges accessing care. These data suggest that programs featuring peers were welcomed, but alternatives to facility-based services are urgently needed to scale up pre-exposure prophylaxis among sexual and gender minority youth aged 15-24 years. We hypothesize that equipping peer lay workers - trained sexual and gender minority youth aged 15-24 years who are part of SGM-affirming health care teams - to deliver pre-exposure prophylaxis to sexual and gender minority youth aged 15-24 years in community venues will increase pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake among sexual and gender minority youth aged 15-24 years. The goal of this project is to conduct a series of studies to refine, test, and understand experiences with a peer-led community-based intervention (Communitypre-exposure prophylaxis, ""COMpre-exposure prophylaxis""). In Aim 1, we will conduct qualitative interviews guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to identify key modifications for the pre-exposure prophylaxis1519 peer navigator intervention to adapt it for community delivery by peer lay workers. In Aim 2, we will randomize 1400 sexual and gender minority youth aged 15-24 years to access pre-exposure prophylaxis through peer lay workers at community venues (COMpre-exposure prophylaxis intervention) or health providers at SGM-affirming health facilities (standard care). We will conduct intent-to-treat analyses with modified Poisson regression to compare pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake (primary outcome) across randomized arms. We will follow the subset that initiates pre-exposure prophylaxis (expected to be N~385) for 12 months to compare secondary outcomes (1-month adherence, 3-month and 12-month persistence). Throughout the trial, we will monitor participant safety through our study team and an external monitoring board. In Aim 3, we will use the RE-AIM framework to explore experiences with the COMpre-exposure prophylaxis intervention through qualitative interviews with sexual and gender minority youth aged 15-24 years, peer lay workers and health providers, and local and national policymakers to develop next steps. The proposed work will provide robust evidence about whether pre-exposure prophylaxis delivery facilitated by peer lay workers in community settings increases pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake, adherence, and persistence among sexual and gender minority youth aged 15-24 years in Brazil. With members of the National HIV Program in Brazil as our collaborators, we will be well-positioned to provide results to guide programming for this population and scale up the intervention if effective.",1,1R01MH135769-01A1,PA-20-183,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,6,5,3,2

An effective vaccine that confers long-term protection against infection would be an essential tool in eradicating AIDS, but all vaccine candidates have been largely unsuccessful to date. This is due to the unique biology of the virus and its extraordinary ability to escape immune responses. The immune events immediately following HIV-1 transmission have critical impacts on the ensuing disease course, but the underlying biology has proven difficult to detail. Overall, the innate immune response to a viral infection can establish a state of viral resistance and contribute to controlling virus replication, but it also induces inflammation that can favor viral spread, immunopathology and disease progression. Studies of prospective cohorts of volunteers at high risk of contracting HIV-1 have revealed the sequence of events during acute infection, including the cytokine storm induced by the innate immune responses. Mechanistic in vitro studies have demonstrated the capacity of diverse innate immune sensors to detect HIV-1 and induce cytokine production. However, the relative contribution of each innate immune cell type and sensing pathway following in vivo HIV-1 infection, and their functional impact on both the virus and the host, are largely unknown. To overcome this limitation, we developed the MISTRG model of mice repopulated with a complete human immune system (""humanized mice""), including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and NK cells that are essential to mounting innate immune responses. MISTRG mice are permissive for HIV-1 infection and recapitulate several aspects of the immune responses observed in humans, including the cytokine storm triggered in the first few weeks after infection. Furthermore, we have recently developed a highly efficient protocol to knockout genes from the human immune system of MISTRG mice, providing genetic tools that were previously exclusive to conventional mouse models. Using the innovative MISTRG model, we now plan to investigate the fundamental in vivo mechanisms of the innate immune response to HIV-1, following infection through both intravenous and mucosal routes. First, we will identify the cellular source of cytokines that are released during the acute phase of HIV-1 infection. We will complement these descriptive studies with functional depletion experiments, to determine how each cytokine-producing cell type affects the virus and the infected host. Second, we will use gene knockout approaches to determine the functional roles of membrane-bound versus intracellular innate immune sensors in the response to HIV-1. We hypothesize that different cell types contribute to HIV-1 sensing in vivo, that they rely on distinct sensors to do so, and that their concerted responses functionally impact the course of disease. Our findings will address a significant knowledge gap, and may inform the rationale design of novel innate immune interventions for the prevention or therapy of HIV-1/AIDS.",1,1R21AI184087-01A1,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,9,11,1,3

Black sexual minority men (Black sexual minority men) in particular, who comprise a substantial proportion of people with HIV, are affected by large health disparities for multiple mental and physical health indicators that increase with age. Aging sexual minority men and Black adults show low social connectedness (loneliness and social isolation), which can lead to poor health outcomes. This application, submitted under PAR-21-350, proposes to use a longitudinal mixed methods social network study to examine how changes in loneliness and social isolation are related to changes in health and wellness among aging Black sexual minority men, and how multileveled social-ecological contextual factors may mediate and moderate these associations, following the Sexual and Gender Minority Health Framework and social isolation and intersectional stigma theories. The Specific Aims are to:  Test associations of longitudinal trajectories of social disconnectedness (loneliness, social isolation) with mental and physical health behaviors (healthcare engagement, adherence), quality of life, and chronic health conditions (including HIV-related outcomes) among aging Black sexual minority men, a population that shows accelerated aging effects (due to physiological ""weathering"" effects of systemic discrimination, and potentially, from HIV and its treatment);  Examine structural (regional), community (neighborhood), social network (interpersonal), and individual level resilience and risk factors that may explain, buffer, or amplify impacts of social disconnectedness on health among Black sexual minority men; and  Engage with community experts to interpret results and discuss next steps for feasible and acceptable multi-level interventions to increase positive social connections among aging Black sexual minority men. We will recruit 400 Black SMM (200 with HIV, 200 without HIV) aged 40 and older, with a focus on high-priority jurisdictions for the US Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative in Southern California and the state of Alabama. Participants will be surveyed at baseline, 6-months, and 12-months; a subset of 80 participants will complete longitudinal in-depth interviews to explain quantitative ratings of loneliness and isolation, and connections and subgroups depicted on their social network diagram, as well as to suggest ideas for potential interventions to address social disconnectedness (e.g., social prescribing, including acceptable activities and groups). In accordance with community-based participatory research principles, we will engage with community experts in Southern California and Alabama to interpret results and discuss ideas for multi-level feasible and acceptable interventions to increase positive social connections and reduce disparities among aging Black sexual minority men. This research is Stage 0-1 along the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development, in which we are collecting basic data in order to generate ideas for intervention, which will be tested in future clinical trials.

Although the pathophysiology of Heart failure is complex and remains incompletely understood, defects in mitochondrial function have been implicated in the progression and outcomes of Heart failure, and emerged as an important target for Heart failure therapy. One well-known contributing factor to adverse cardiac remodeling in the failing hearts is excess mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species). Accordingly, a variety of antioxidant-based therapies have been developed for Heart failure treatment over the last decades. However, despite promising outcomes in preclinical studies, translation of these therapies to the clinic has not succeeded to date, suggesting that alternative or complementary mitochondrial therapeutic targets are needed. In addition to excess mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species, profound loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (m) is another key hallmark of Heart failure. In the cardiomyocyte (cardiomyocyte), m disruption affects not only energy production, but also a variety of signaling pathways crucial for cell function and survival, such as redox balance, calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial quality control. We hypothesize that synergistically targeting mitochondria, i.e., concurrently preserving mitochondrial m and scavenging excess mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species, is a viable therapeutic strategy for Heart failure treatment. However, assessing the therapeutic potential of m preservation is challenging, due to a lack of tools for dynamic and specific control of cardiomyocyte m in live animals. To overcome this technical barrier, we developed an innovative mitochondrial-targeted luminoptogenetic (named mLumOpto) technology by integrating luciferaseluciferin-emitted endogenous bioluminescence with the mitochondrial optogenetics we recently published. Our preliminary data indicate that mLumOpto can induce dynamic cardiomyocyte m control in the absence of external light illumination. The primary goal of this project is to employ this advanced mLumOpto technology to manipulate cardiomyocyte m in vivo to evaluate the efficacy of cardiomyocyte m preservation alone, or in synergism with a mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species scavenger (i.e., mitochondrial-specific antioxidant), in Heart failure treatment in preclinical mouse models. The translational potential of the proposed synergistic mitochondrial-targeted Heart failure therapy will also be assessed in human-like large animals (i.e., pigs). Three Specific Aims are proposed to accomplish our objectives. Aim 1 will determine the role of sustained cardiomyocyte m depolarization in pathological cardiac remodeling and Heart failure development in mice, and dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms. Aim 2 will evaluate the efficacy of synergistic m preservation and mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species scavenging in improving adverse cardiac remodeling and contractile dysfunction in two well-established mouse Heart failure models (i.e., pressure overload and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion). Aim 3 will assess the translational potential of mLumOpto-mediated Heart failure therapy in pigs. Successful completion of this project will lead to not only an innovative technology capable of specifically and dynamically manipulating cardiomyocyte mitochondria in vivo, but also a novel translational mitochondrial-targeted therapy for Heart failure treatment.",5,5R01HL160690-02,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,2,0,0

While defects in mitochondrial function are strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of Heart failure, no mitochondrial-targeted therapy has been successful in the clinic to date, indicating that we still do not possess sufficient understanding of the mechanisms connecting mitochondrial dysfunction and Heart failure development. Normal mitochondrial functions rely on maintaining the inner membrane potential (m). In the cardiomyocyte (cardiomyocyte), m perturbations not only directly affect ATP production, but also influence a variety of signaling pathways that modulate redox balance, Ca2+ homeostasis, and mitochondrial quality control. However, to what extent and how the loss of cardiomyocyte m alone impairs cardiac energetics, contractility, and electrical activity (i.e., hallmarks of Heart failure) remains poorly defined. This is due, in part, to a lack of methods for effectively and selectively manipulating cardiomyocyte mitochondria in the in vivo setting. Existing pharmacological approaches to depolarize m lack both cell (cardiomyocyte versus non-cardiomyocyte) and organ (cardiac versus non-cardiac) specificity. To overcome this technical barrier, we developed an innovative mitochondrial-targeted luminoptogenetic (overcome this technical barrier, we developed an innovative mitochondrial-targeted luminoptogenetic) technology and demonstrated that it can induce dynamic, selective cardiomyocyte m depolarization both in vitro and in vivo, with luciferase-luciferin pair-emitted intracellular bioluminescent illumination. The primary goal of this proposal is to utilize the mLumOpto technology to directly induce cardiomyocyte-specific m depolarization in intact hearts, and delineate the acute (i.e. <24 hours) and chronic (i.e. 2 weeks) impacts on cardiac functions. Our hypothesis is that cardiomyocyte-specific m depolarization alone is sufficient to induce adverse cardiac remodeling and Heart failure development, which will be tested with the following Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will fully characterize mLumOpto-mediated m depolarization in isolated adult cardiomyocytes (Acardiomyocytes) in vitro, and establish luciferin dose dependency. How the mLumOpto-mediated m depolarization acutely and chronically impacts Acardiomyocyte function and health, respectively, will be dissected. Specific Aim 2 will determine the acute effect of cardiomyocyte-specific m depolarization in intact hearts. First, mLumOpto-mediated in vivo cardiomyocyte-specific m depolarization will be determined. Then, the acute effects of cardiomyocyte m depolarization on cardiac metabolism, pump function, and electrophysiology in intact hearts will be examined both ex vivo and in vivo. Specific Aim 3 will delineate the chronic effects of moderate cardiomyocyte m depolarization on cardiac remodeling (at gravimetric, histologic, biochemical, electrophysiological, and molecular levels) that lead to contractile dysfunction and Heart failure development. The reversibility of cardiomyocyte m depolarization-induced Heart failure will also be examined. Successful completion of this research will lead to not only an innovative technology for dynamic control of cardiomyocyte mitochondria in freely-moving animals, but also new findings that will lead us to novel avenues for the development and translation of future mitochondrial-targeted Heart failure therapies.",5,5R01HL156581-04,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",8,7,0,0

Current clinical monitoring algorithms rely on frequent invasive procedures including endomyocardial biopsies and catheter angiography. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed non-invasive comprehensive cardiac MRI, which can quantify regional changes in myocardial tissue and function. Our efforts have focused on the 2 major complications of HTx: 1) acute cardiac rejection (acute cardiac rejection), the leading cause of death in the first year after transplant; and 2) cardiac allograft vasculopathy (cardiac allograft vasculopathy), the greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality beyond the first post-Tx year. Our cardiac MRI studies have identified new imaging biomarkers in HTx. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between abnormal cardiac MRI measures and potential allograft failure: myocardial T2 and extracellular volume fraction (extracellular volume fraction) as non-invasive tissue biomarkers for acute cardiac rejection. We demonstrated that the natural history of myocardial scarring, T2, and extracellular volume fraction predicts adverse clinical events in HTx recipients. In addition, our studies showed that donor and recipient mismatch (age, sex, weight, etc.) was significantly associated with cardiac MRI-derived measures of myocardial edema/inflammation, fibrosis, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Over the past five years, the PIs have assembled a unique study database with over >450 comprehensive cardiac MRI exams comprising >110,000 annotated cardiac MRI images. For this renewal application, we identified the need to conduct further long-term follow-up studies tailored to the slow disease progression in HTx to identify changes over time in multiparametric MRI measures and predictors of HTx outcome. Second, data on graft tissue and function in the pediatric HTx population are scarce and improved strategies for donor-recipient matching in this vulnerable population are needed to make most efficient use of the limited availability of donor hearts in children. Thus, cardiac MRI needs to better account for age and sex related differences in patient habitus and physiology, critical for the wide age range in HTx from pediatric to adult. The renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop multiparametric cardiac MRI for the assessment of graft tissue (T2, T1, extracellular volume fraction), and dysfunction (myocardial velocities, strain) from pediatric to adult, 2) leverage the existing large cardiac MRI database (110,000 labeled cardiac MRI images) to establish deep learning based analysis pipelines for automated cardiac MRI analysis with improved efficiency and reduced inter-rater variability, 3) to identify predictors of adverse outcomes and to evaluate the impact of donor-recipient mismatch on graft tissue, function, and flow in a prospective study with pediatric HTx patients, and 4) to identify cardiac metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) HTx patient outcome by leveraging our HTx database (>145 HTx recipients with existing baseline cardiac MRI acquired during the initial funding cycle). Follow-up cardiac MRI will provide unique insights in changes over time in graft tissue and function as mechanism underlying different HTx patient trajectories (non-progression vs. late onset vs. slow progression vs. fast progression).",5,5R01HL117888-09,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",19,4,0,3

However, Hematopoietic cell transplantation-related factors, such as total body irradiation used for conditioning, graft-versus-host disease, and prolonged exposure to immunosuppressive therapy, result in very high risk for subsequent skin cancers. Compared with the general population, Hematopoietic cell transplantation survivors are also more likely to develop skin cancers at a younger age, have advanced disease at presentation, and experience multiple recurrences. Despite this high burden, less than 20% of long-term Hematopoietic cell transplantation survivors report being examined for skin cancer, even though >90% were seen by their primary care physician (primary care physician) in the prior year. In Hematopoietic cell transplantation survivors, skin cancers develop at a time when their follow-up care has largely transitioned from oncology care to the primary care setting, emphasizing the need to develop innovative strategies that 1) provide Hematopoietic cell transplantation survivors with the skills to conduct effective skin self-examinations, and prompt action from their providers when worrisome lesions are found; 2) engage primary care physician in Hematopoietic cell transplantation risk-based screening for skin cancer; and 3) ensure rapid access to dermatologic exams. Advances in technology, including widespread availability of cell phones and teledermoscopy (remote expert assessment of a photographed lesion) offer promising opportunities to improve early detection and treatment of skin cancer. We propose a comparative effectiveness study that will examine the impact of patient activation and education (patient activation and education), alone or in combination with physician-tailored strategies, on clinically meaningful behavioral outcomes. We will enroll 720 Hematopoietic cell transplantation survivors at a large, diverse Hematopoietic cell transplantation center to: 1) Determine the impact of patient activation and education alone or with physician activation (patient activation and education+Phys) on skin cancer screening and prevention practices at 12 months; and 2) Among primary care physician of Hematopoietic cell transplantation survivors, determine the impact of a teledermoscopy e-learning program compared with provision of print materials for identifying suspect lesions. We hypothesize that compared to patient activation and education, patients randomized to patient activation and education+Phys will report higher rates of thorough selfand provider skin exam, shorter time to referral of suspicious lesions, and improved quality of life; compared to print materials alone, physicians randomized to teledermoscopy e-learning will have greater recognition of suspect lesions and more appropriate, cost-effective referral patterns. Our multi-disciplinary team will: 1) establish the efficacy of patient activation and education, and the relative benefit of physician activation; 2) inform the practice of skin cancer screening using innovative mobile strategies that are readily applicable in the clinical setting; and 3) identify facilitators of and barriers to appropriate delivery of survivorship-focused preventive care for long-term Hematopoietic cell transplantation survivors. Information obtained from the current study can be used to develop strategies for management of other late effects (e.g. cardiovascular, endocrine) in Hematopoietic cell transplantation survivors in the primary care setting, and to improve skin cancer screening in other high-risk (e.g. radiation-exposed) cancer survivor populations.",5,5R01CA249460-05,RFA-CA-19-035,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,1,3,3,2

Hematopoietic stem cells like most adult stem cells, are mainly quiescent. Quiescence is proposed to protect Hematopoietic stem cells from replicative and metabolic stress that would otherwise impact health and longevity, thereby enabling them to maintain tissue homeostasis and allowing for the repair of defective/damaged tissue during their lifetime. Progress in HSC-based therapies is partly hindered by lack of reliable approaches to modulate HSC quiescence and activity. Thus, understanding the core molecular mechanisms of HSC quiescence is fundamental for improving HSC health and longevity and has major translational implications for the clinic. By applying a new approach based on mitochondrial membrane potential (membrane potential), we identified the most dormant subsets of both human and mouse Hematopoietic stem cells. Using this approach, we recently discovered that lysosomal activity is pivotal for the maintenance of mouse HSC quiescence. Our findings suggest that lysosomes dynamically regulate the hematopoietic stem cell switch between quiescent and active states. Here, we propose to investigate lysosomal function and the effects of modulation of lysosomal activity on the potency of human Hematopoietic stem cells. These studies are likely to provide means towards extending the availability of human Hematopoietic stem cells. Overall, translation of our findings to human Hematopoietic stem cells will build the foundation towards advancing cell therapy.",5,5R01HL161567-03,PAS-18-730,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",16,0,4,4

Following primary infection of the cornea, Herpes simplex type virus-1 establishes latency in sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglia (trigeminal ganglia). Reactivation of Herpes simplex type virus-1 from latently infected trigeminal ganglia leads to shedding of the virus in tears causing recurrent ocular herpetic disease, a major cause of infectious blindness in the Western world. Currenly, an FDA-approved herpes simplex vaccine is unavailable. Our long-term goal is to develop an immunotherapeutic ocular herpes vaccine. While a role for CD8+ T cells (but not CD4+ T cells) in reducing HSV1 reactivations from latently infected trigeminal ganglia is gaining wider acceptance, the small numbers of functional tissueresident memory CD8+ TRM cells that are present in latently infected trigeminal ganglia are not enough to prevent virus reactivation. We have made several significant findings, during the last funding period:  HSV-specific CD8+ T cells from ""naturally protected"" HLA-A*0201-positive asymptomatic individuals (who never develop recurrent ocular herpetic disease despite being infected) mainly targeted five Herpes simplex type virus-1 epitopes;  Phenotypic and transcriptomicprofiling indicates that frequent HSV-specific CD8+ TRM cells, which expressed high levels of tissue-homing and tissue-residency receptors (i.e. CXCR3, IL-2R/IL-15R, CD69, and CD103), found in the trigeminal ganglia of Herpes simplex type virus-1 infected HLA-A*0201 transgenic rabbits (HLA-A*0201 transgenic rabbits) are associated with decreased virus shedding;  Topical ocular delivery to latently infected HLA-A*0201 transgenic rabbits of prototype neurotropic adenoassociated virus (AAV8) constructs, which express either the T cell attracting CXCL11 chemokine (CXCR3 ligand) or IL-2/IL-15 cytokines (IL-2Rb/IL-15Rb ligands), increased the frequency of trigeminal ganglia-resident CD8+ TRM cells specific to the five immunodominant epitopes;  Increased numbers of exhausted trigeminal ganglia-resident CD8+ TRM cells were associated with increased virus shedding in HLA-A*0201 transgenic rabbits; and  Ex vivo blockade of T cells exhaustion pathways PD-1, LAG-3 and TIGIT, ex vivo, in rabbit trigeminal ganglia explants significantly reduced virus reactivation. Building on the above published and preliminary results, the central hypothesis of this revised competitive renewal proposal is that a trigeminal ganglia-targeted vaccine that boosts the number, function and longevity of anti-viral trigeminal ganglia-resident CD8+TRM cells will reduce virus reactivation and shedding. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that a tissue-targeted Prime/Pull/Keep therapeutic vaccine (designated as PPK vaccine) that incorporates the five immunodominant Herpes simplex type virus-1 CD8+ TRM cell epitopes (prime), CXCL11 (pull) and IL-2/IL-15 (keep) will boost the number and longevity of trigeminal ganglia-resident CD8+ TRM cells and significantly decrease Herpes simplex type virus-1 reactivation in latently infected HLA-A*0201 transgenic rabbits. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that tissue-targeted PPK vaccine combined with blockade of PD-1, LAG-3 and/or TIGIT immune checkpoints will increase the number of functional CD8+ TRM cells in the trigeminal ganglia and produce even more robust protection in latently infected HLA-A*0201 transgenic rabbits.

Current drugs show increasing numbers of treatment failure, low efficacy, difficult treatment regimens or severe side effects. In a unique industrial-academic collaboration, the PIs, in collaboration with GSK, ran a high-throughput screen (high-throughput screen) of ~46,000 kinase-targeted inhibitors against Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of Human African trypanosomiasis. This resulted in the discovery of 797 potent (T brucei EC50<1 μM; pEC50 6) and selective hits (>100-fold over HepG2 cells) that were sorted into 59 structural clusters, plus 53 singletons. 14 chemotypes including 13 clusters and 1 singleton have been explored for their structure-activity and structure-property relationships. A ""parasite-hopping"" approach has identified six of these with interesting activity against T cruzi (Chagas diseases (NTDs). This competitive renewal outlines a hit-to-lead medicinal chemistry program that will continue to optimize high-priority hit clusters from the original high-throughput screen. These have been identified through re-analysis of the original high-throughput screen data to place an emphasis on compounds that are cidal and predicted to cross the blood-brain barrier (blood-brain barrier) which is essential to treat stage 2 of Human African trypanosomiasis. Additionally, we will employ computer-aided drug discovery to further explore those chemotypes for which we have identified a putative target. We will also perform hit-to-lead medicinal chemistry optimization on the six chemotypes that have been identified as of interest for T cruzi. We will also look for synergistic effects between clusters that have complementary activity profiles (e.g. slow acting, cidal in nature, and fast acting, static in nature) and in combination with standard trypanocidal drugs. Optimization will result in the delivery of high-quality lead compounds from each of these chemical classes, and the lead compounds will meet stringent profiles of cellular potency and selectivity, blood-brain barrier permeability, physicochemical and metabolic properties, and pharmacokinetic properties in mice depending on the diseases (NTDs targeted. Furthermore, these lead series will display in vivo efficacy in the murine models of diseases (NTDs. The optimization program will be performed under the continuing collaboration between NEU and CSIC, with critical contributions of expertise in drug metabolism and physicochemical properties experiments from AstraZeneca and UCSD. We have developed and implemented a testing funnel that ensures that the optimization process will address the most critical lead criteria. Finally, we will perform the target identification and mode of action studies by different approaches including chemical proteomics, induction of resistance and whole genome sequencing and metabolic fingerprinting. This project will deliver (a) multiple lead compounds for Human African trypanosomiasis and Chagas diseases (NTDs that meet well-defined Lead Criteria; (b) broader profiling of lead compounds against more stringent Candidate Criteria; (c) identification of target for lead series or compound.

Exploring bias in NHANES human biomonitoring data.,"ABSTRACT Human biomonitoring (Human biomonitoring) - the measurement of a chemical, its reaction product, or metabolite in biosamples - is an exposure assessment technique that is often considered the ""gold standard"" in exposure assessment. The US uses the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) as a vehicle for sample collection for its national Human biomonitoring program. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data collection occurs in Mobile Examination Centers (Mobile Examination Centers), large trailers containing a mobile laboratory. Scheduling site locations for data collection includes considerations such as seasonal weather patterns and difficulties with Mobile Examination Centers unit transit. Because Mobile Examination Centers units cannot easily traverse difficult roadways with snow and ice patching, logistics require that sampling in areas often hit with harsh winter weather occur during the warmer months (i.e., spring and summer) whereas more temperate locations can be sampled in cooler months (i.e., winter and autumn). Given this, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data that may vary by season could be subject to both temporal and spatial bias. This potential bias could, in turn, lead to inaccurate interpretations of population exposure and health data. We will evaluate any bias in Human biomonitoring data of seasonal chemicals from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey using two specific aims. 1) Conduct state-level and seasonal evaluations of distributions of seasonal and non-seasonal chemical urinary biomarkers in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Cycles 1999-2016 using the NCHS Research Data Center allowing access to restricted geocodes and sampling dates. 2) Compare National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey state-level urinary pesticide metabolite data to smaller-scale biomonitoring studies conducted in different US states during different seasons.

Left untreated, hypospadias may affect quality of life, cosmetic appearance, urination, sexual function, and fertility. Currently, parents must make this important, preference-sensitive treatment decision with neither evidence-based guidance nor a clearly superior option. Consequently, 55-71% of parents experience decisional regret regardless of whether they choose surgery which is strongly associated with decisional conflict. We aim to reduce parental decisional conflict and regret by improving information delivery through use of a shared decision-making (shared decision-making) tool called the Hypospadias Hub. It was developed and pilot-tested at two U.S. sites by our team. The objective of this proposal is to conduct a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of the Hypospadias Hub Intervention. Our two-arm randomized controlled trial will assess its effectiveness to: 1) improve quality of shared decision-making during hypospadias consultations as measured by parent report (primary outcome), and observer report (secondary outcome), 2) decrease decisional conflict and regret, and increase decision-relevant hypospadias knowledge (secondary outcome), 2) decrease decisional conflict and regret, and increase decision-relevant hypospadias knowledge). We will also assess barriers and facilitators to its future implementation. Our aims are 1. Compare the effect of the Hypospadias Hub Intervention vs. control on the quality of shared decision-making (primary outcome). We will assess how providers influence parents' choices using qualitative content analysis of transcripts of the consultations. Parents will be randomized to the respective arms of the study. Hypothesis: The quality of shared decision-making during the consultation will be higher in the intervention than the control group. 2. Compare the effect of the Hypospadias Hub Intervention vs. control on decisional conflict, decision-relevant knowledge, and decisional regret (secondary outcome), 2) decrease decisional conflict and regret, and increase decision-relevant hypospadias knowledge). Hypothesis: Decisional conflict and regret will be lower, and knowledge higher in the intervention vs. control group. 3. Assess barriers and facilitators to future implementation using constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. We will use qualitative interviews with a diverse sample of parents, providers, nurses, and clinic staff to explore recommendations for implementation, and potential future implementation strategies. Evidence of the effectiveness of the Hypospadias Hub Intervention to improve quality of shared decision-making and decision quality for parents making decisions about hypospadias, combined with insights gained from our implementation assessment, will support wider adoption, and inform development of tools for other preference-sensitive decisions, which will improve child health and quality of life.",1,1R01DK140178-01,PA-20-183,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,1,3,3,2

However, these analyses have not differentiated the Hypothalamic amenorrhea phenotype from polycystic ovary syndrome (polycystic ovary syndrome) and other lower prevalence menstrual disorders. Emerging data from our group indicates that one-third of women with Hypothalamic amenorrhea (mean age 27 yrs) have preclinical cardiovascular disease measured noninvasively as vascular dysfunction, and circulating cytokine patterns indicative of vascular inflammation compared to age-matched eumenorrheic controls not on hormone therapy. Our proposed research application responds to the funding opportunity announcement PA-20-281, ""Fertility Status as a Marker for Overall Health"" and will study Hypothalamic amenorrhea, a marker of fertility status, related to cardiovascular health. In Aim 1, we will use innovative remote patient monitoring and patient reported outcomes to investigate Hypothalamic amenorrhea specific phenotype(s) related to preclinical cardiovascular disease (Aim 1a) and vascular inflammation (Aim 1b). We will then expand our analysis in Aim 2 to the Nurses' Health Study II, a large prospective cohort study that can now phenotype women with Hypothalamic amenorrhea in the premenopausal years and determine associations with subsequent 30 year incident cardiovascular disease risk factors and clinical cardiovascular disease events. Understanding the Hypothalamic amenorrhea phenotype(s) related to cardiovascular disease is a crucial next step to identify women at-risk in order to take preventive action and improve overall cardiovascular disease health. Early identification of young at-risk women presents a unique opportunity to intervene earlier in life when cardiovascular disease preventive approaches are most beneficial. Further, preclinical cardiovascular disease is a multi-organ disease that left untreated can manifest in neurocognitive disorders, peripheral cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease that contribute to health disparities in women. The outcome of the proposed research will identify young women at risk of cardiovascular disease using Hypothalamic amenorrhea phenotyping to inform the design of next step intervention trials and, ultimately, to translate our findings to clinical care to address the cardiovascular disease epidemic in younger women using existing and emerging cardiovascular preventive strategies.",5,5R01HD106096-05,PAR-20-281,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,1,3,3,2

Although this approach has been clinically explored using high or low or high plus low dose Image guided radiotherapy plus untargeted checkpoint immunotherapy, further improvements are warranted and require testing in appropriate clinical studies and preclinical models. In this application we propose three aims to test our hypothesis that Image guided radiotherapy and or targeted alpha therapy (targeted alpha therapy) followed immediately by immunocytokine (immunocytokine), a form of targeted immunotherapy, will lead to increased tumor infiltration of IFN+ CD8s (to increased tumor infiltration of IFN+ CD8s) and decreased Foxp3+ CD4s (Treg). This hypothesis is supported by two studies targeting CEA, a major marker of solid tumor malignancies (eg. colon and breast), in CEA transgenic mice that are immunocompetent, express CEA in normal tissues, and are tolerant to CEA. We now propose to test this hypothesis in two clinical trials, aims 1 (Image guided radiotherapy + immunocytokine) and 2 (targeted alpha therapy), and perform immunocorrelate studies for to increased tumor infiltration of IFN+ CD8s and Treg cells, among others, on preand post-therapy biopsies. Aim 2 is a targeted alpha therapy only study as a prelude to a third clinical trial combining targeted alpha therapy plus immunocytokine, that will be initiated at the end of the project period. In aim 3, we will refine our animal studies to determine tumor microenvironment changes immediately after sequential therapy for both Image guided radiotherapy plus immunocytokine or targeted alpha therapy plus immunocytokine, by a combination of PET imaging for CEA, CD8s and stromal cells by fibroblast activated protein (fibroblast activated protein), along with flow and IHC analysis of tumors, LNs and spleen. We expect the results of aims 1 and 2 to further guide aim 3, and the results of aim 3 to guide future trials that incorporate Image guided radiotherapy and/or targeted alpha therapy plus immunocytokine in CEA positive malignancies.",5,5R01CA283603-02,PAR-22-198,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Unfortunately, over 50% of patients do not respond to these therapies. Combination strategies with chemotherapy-Immune checkpoint inhibitors show progress, but long-term responses remain rare, pointing to the role for other tumor-associated mechanisms affecting functionality of immune cells. Adenosinergic signaling has recently emerged as a powerful immuno-metabolic regulator within the tumor microenvironment (tumor microenvironment) exploited by tumors to promote their growth and suppress immunity. Preclinical studies on interference with adenosine generation or signaling through A2A and A2B adenosine receptors (A2B adenosine receptors) have demonstrated efficacy in relieving this immunosuppression by reducing stress in the tumor microenvironment and decreasing expression of key adenosine-generating enzymes, thereby enhancing efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition. A2B adenosine receptors blockade in particular enhanced anti-tumor immunity through both a reduction in myeloid-derived suppressor cell differentiation and an enhancement of the capacity of dendritic cells to evoke anti-tumor T cell responses. These findings provide strong rationale for clinical applications of A2B adenosine receptors antagonists in combination with current Immune checkpoint inhibitors. To determine whether disruption of A2B adenosine receptors signaling has the potential to improve upon single agent PD-1 immunotherapy, we propose a phase Ib clinical trial testing the A2B adenosine receptors antagonist PBF-1129 in combination with nivolumab in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The primary objective of the clinical study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination PBF-1129 with nivolumab; preliminary evidence of efficacy will be evaluated in an expansion cohort. Analysis of preand ontreatment blood and tumor samples will be conducted to evaluate the correlation between and immunological parameters and adenosine generation and signaling, and to evaluate the efficacy of PBF-1129 in targeting adenosine-mediated immunosuppression. Finally, we intend to further elucidate mechanisms of metabolic tumor microenvironment and immune regulation by adenosine in pre-clinical cancer models and test the combined PBF-1129/anti-PD-1 approach to ameliorate metabolic tumor microenvironment using a novel imaging modality. Together, we expect that A2B adenosine receptors antagonist treatment combined with nivolumab will be a safe, effective approach targeting different mechanisms of immunosuppression and tumor growth in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients, that we will uncover immunological profiles reflective of adenosinergic signaling disruption in these patients, and that we will demonstrate the utility of a novel combined imaging approach for evaluation of adenosine targeting in the tumor microenvironment.",5,5R01CA248741-04,PAR-18-560,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Herein, two experienced interdisciplinary laboratory and clinical teams at UCSFs Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and Northwestern University's Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center join efforts to develop innovative immunotherapy approaches against glioblastoma. This proposal leverages industry and institutional support to address three specific objectives: 1) to improve our understanding of the role of immunotherapy approaches in glioblastoma; 2) to improve our understanding of how to overcome the limitation the blood brain barrier and 3) to develop innovative immunotherapy treatments for glioblastoma, with associated early clinical trials focused on patients suffering from recurrent glioblastoma. Project 1, coordinated from Northwestern, will build on the team's preclinical results in mouse brain tumor models demonstrating an immunomodulatory and sensitization effect when immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is preceded by a immunogenic dose of doxorubicin, an effect that can be further enhanced by ultrasound-based BBB opening. Support by innovative biotech companies (Agenus, AstraZeneca, Carthera) provide drugs or devices for preclinical and clinical investigation as well as specific expertise, assays and technology for investigations at both institutions, making this collaboration a very powerful consortium. The ensuing clinical trial will investigate the novel anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor balstilimab in conjunction with doxorubicin, with and without sonication for BBB opening. By administration of immune therapy prior to surgery (induction therapy, neoadjuvant treatment) the immune effect enables us to evaluate in vivo immune response in the resected brain tissue. We have previously identified pERk/MAPK activation as a biomarker for benefit from anti-PD1 treatment in recurrent glioblastoma; this and other markers will be explored furthermore. Four prospectively treated cohorts will be treated with and without induction therapy, and with and without BBB opening. Translational endpoints include immune response (tumor tissue, peripheral) and drug tissue concentration. Project 2, coordinated from UCSF, is a study based on the exciting novel synthetic Notch ""synNotch"" receptor CART system and pioneering T cell circuits that recognize tumor cells based on a ""prime-and-kill"" strategy. In this system, the first antigen, which is expressed exclusively on GBM cells (EGFRvIII), primes the T cells to induce expression of a CAR that recognizes IL-13Rα2 and EphA2, thereby eradicating GBM cells expressing either EphA2 or IL-13α2. Project 2's team hypothesizes that synNotch CART cells can revolutionize the CART therapy for glioblastoma by overcoming the challenges of off-tumor toxicity, antigen heterogeneity, and CART cell exhaustion. Thus, these synNotch-CART cells are hypothesized to be significantly more efficacious than conventional, constitutively expressed IL-13Rα2/EphA2 CART cells. Investigators will optimize the efficacy of the lead agent and test this hypothesis in the first in human clinical trial of this new class of agents in glioblastoma patients. This U19 proposal also has set aside funds for support of the distinctly important trans-GTN pilot projects, and for two cores (Administrative, Immune Monitoring & Biospecimen) that will support the efforts of the two projects. By addressing the overall specific objectives described, the research proposed in this U19 application has a high likelihood of changing the way immunotherapy is understood and utilized in glioblastoma. The innovative research described in this proposal will take advantage of the exceptional resources assembled by the wellestablished, collaborative group of clinical and basic scientists at UCSF and Northwestern.",5,5U19CA264338-04,RFA-CA-20-047,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

In the U.S., California has the highest incidence and largest number of tuberculosis cases in the nation, comprising nearly one-quarter of all new active tuberculosis cases in 2017. More than 80% of active tuberculosis disease in the U.S. is due to reactivation, which could be prevented via screening and treatment of LtuberculosisI. Yet, adoption of the latent tuberculosis screening and treatment guidelines has been extremely poor. The screening guidelines are inefficient and rely on data that are almost never available to clinicians, and the treatment guidelines are confusing. Further, treatment initiation and completion rates are low for patients with LtuberculosisI and the barriers to successful treatment are poorly understood. To address these missed opportunities, we will use expansive electronic health record data across 2 of the largest healthcare institutions in California as well as qualitative data from LtuberculosisI stakeholders to conduct three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will look at current gaps in screening practices for LtuberculosisI, as well as gaps in the guidelines themselves, by simulating what it would look like if screening was being perfectly implemented. To do this, we will collect laboratory testing data for LtuberculosisI stratified by characteristics of interest and will use modeling to estimate the number of tuberculosis cases prevented by current screening as a measure of effectiveness. We will use simulation models to estimate effectiveness of optimal screening. For Aim 2, we will develop and validate new screening and treatment guidelines for LtuberculosisI based on variables widely available in electronic health records. First, we will use machine learning and traditional regression to identify risk factors for positive LtuberculosisI tests and reactivation tuberculosis. Next, we will assign risk scores to each risk factor, and will use joint probability analyses to identify populations at greatest need for screening and treatment. To estimate performance of the newly proposed strategy, we will use simulation modeling. For Aim 3, we will develop and pilot a culturally-tailored educational video intervention to improve LtuberculosisI treatment initiation and completion. We will first identify barriers to treatment adherence through qualitative interviews with patients and providers and will subsequently develop a short video based on findings from the interview. We will perform an individually randomized efficacy trial to assess impact of the intervention on initiation and treatment completion rates. The approach is innovative because we propose a complete re-framing of the current U.S. LtuberculosisI control strategy in a way that dramatically enhances ease-of-use for frontline providers. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to public health by providing low-cost and easily expandable solutions to address ongoing and substantial gaps in the current LtuberculosisI care continuum.",5,5R01AI151072-05,PA-19-055,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,7,9,1,3

Significance. Latinx and Asian American communities face unique, yet similar structural and social inequities contributing to poor diet quality, which have contributed to the increased burden of diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in these groups. The past two years has exacerbated these barriers due to overt anti-immigrant and anti-Asian sentiment during the pandemic, invoking fear, cultural shame, and loss of a sense of security for these groups - factors which have fueled challenges towards accessing food and economic stability. Approach. Working collaboratively with four farming/gardening organizations, one elementary school and three community-based organizations, our aims are: Aim 1: To implement a whole-of-community intervention in Sunset Park for improving diet and the social/built environments for low-income Mexican and Chinese American immigrants. The BASIS program will include inlanguage navigation for food business owners/residents to government assistance / workforce development programs; a subsidized fresh produce box program; gardening and nutrition education; and a social marketing campaign to promote healthy eating behavior changes and cultural awareness. Materials will be culturally appropriate and specific to each community, yet also highlight similarities across both groups. Aim 2: To evaluate the BASIS program impact at the community, interpersonal and individual levels . The evaluation plan will employ administrative data sources and mixed methods to assess outcomes at multiple levels. Outcomes will be assessed in Sunset Park and in 4 comparison communities that are predominantly Mexican and Chinese American (Corona, East Harlem; Chinatown, Elmhurst, respectively). We hypothesize that stability in the food retail sector and improvements in neighborhood social cohesion, diet, ethnic pride and sense of belonging will be observed in Sunset Park vs. comparison communities. Aim 3: To co-develop a multi-faceted sustainability strategy with multi-sector stakeholders. Sustainability is a central priority of the BASIS program and is driven by commitment to community priorities; investment in infrastructure and workforce development; and engagement in the local food policy dialogue. Impact.BASIS presents a powerful model to improve diet in immigrant communities by addressing determinants of food access in a community-centered, culturally competent way, and by fortifying community empowerment.",5,5R01MD018204-03,RFA-MD-22-007,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES,1,5,3,2

The high phenotypic and functional plasticity and the high penetration rate in several solid tumor types including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) make Mφ cell therapy ideal for solid tumor treatment. To overwrite their immune suppressive program once infiltrated in solid tumors, Mφs can be engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (chimeric antigen receptors) to redirect their specificity and function. Phosphatidylserine (Phosphatidylserine) is a negatively charged amino-phospholipid mostly confined to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane bilayers, but flipped to the outer membrane under lethal stress. Phosphatidylserine is a universal ""eat-me"" antigen of apoptotic cells and often abnormally externalized by cancer cells. We hypothesize that Phosphatidylserine targeted CAR Mφs (α-Phosphatidylserine CAR-Ms) may be a universal ""third-party, off-the-shelf"" adjuvant cell therapy of traditional therapies for solid tumor treatment, because cancer treatment modalities such as targeted therapies can induce transient but massive tumor cell apoptosis. To verify it, we employed KRAS-addicted pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models for pilot studies and have created an α-Phosphatidylserine CAR that can provoke antigen specific phagocytotic and cytotoxic activities in Mφs against KRAS inhibitor (KRASi)-treated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. Due to structure conserveness of Phosphatidylserine in human and mouse, α-Phosphatidylserine CAR-Ms reacted with both mouse and human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells post KRASi treatment. In the project, we propose to demonstrate the anti-tumor effect of α-Phosphatidylserine CAR-Ms as an adjuvant therapy of KRASi in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma xenograft models and mouse spontaneous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models and dissect the working mechanisms of α-Phosphatidylserine CAR-Ms. Aim 1. Demonstrate α-Phosphatidylserine CAR activities in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models. Aim 1a will generate αPhosphatidylserine CAR-Ms using human primary Mφs and perform functional assays in vitro to determine antigen-specific phagocytosis and cell killing. In addition, we will explore whether combination with inhibitors targeting natural Phosphatidylserine receptors on Mφs and blockage of the ""don't-eat-me"" signal will further enhance tumoricidal activities of α-Phosphatidylserine CAR-Ms. Aim 1b will determine the polarization status of α-Phosphatidylserine CAR-Ms by flow cytometry analysis and dissect the molecular reprogramming by -omic analysis. Aim 1c will demonstrate the tumoricidal activity of α-Phosphatidylserine CARMs as an adjuvant therapy of KRASi in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma xenograft models. Aim 2. Determine the tumoricidal activity of α-Phosphatidylserine CAR-Ms in immunocompetent mouse models. We hypothesize that murine α-Phosphatidylserine CAR-Ms can not only kill pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells directly but may also rewire the tumor immune microenvironment to further provoke anti-tumor immune response. Aim 2a will produce murine α-Phosphatidylserine CAR-Ms and determine their phagocytotic and killing activities against KRASi-treated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells. After validation, we will examine whether α-Phosphatidylserine CAR-Ms are effective to impair tumor growth and prevent tumor recurrence as an adjuvant therapy of KRASi in spontaneous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma mouse models. Aim 2b will characterize the TME remodeling by α-Phosphatidylserine CAR-Ms via immunophenotyping and delineate the potential intercellular crosstalk within immune cell types.",1,1R21CA286398-01A1,PAR-22-216,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Investing in integrated nurturing care interventions from preconception through childhood and adolescence defines one's developmental trajectory with benefits that accumulate across the life course and promote social justice (i.e., taking equity one step further by fixing the systems for generations to come). COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted essential nurturing care services such as prenatal, perinatal, and pediatric services. As a result, over a million preventable child and maternal deaths globally are projected to occur due to extreme poverty and household food insecurity (HFI; lack of consistent access to enough healthful food for an active, healthy life due to limited financial resources). Amid the COVID-19, HFI in the US tripled among households with children (~19.5%), disproportionately burdening marginalized low income and families of color. HFI is strongly linked with racial/ethnic inequities and adverse maternal-child health and nutrition outcomes. Integrating effective food security interventions within nurturing care services as a COVID-19 response & recovery efforts is an achievable strategy to promote equity. The West Las Vegas Promise Neighborhood (West Las Vegas Promise Neighborhood) is an intervention addressing social determinants of health to reduce structural racism amid COVID-19 in historically racial/ethnic marginalized communities in the Southwest US. The West Las Vegas Promise Neighborhood is implemented by over 50 multi-sector partners in key life domains (health, education, employment, housing, and social justice) coordinated by Nevada Partners, Inc., with whom we have a solid and long-term collaboration. While West Las Vegas Promise Neighborhood social intervention is a unique opportunity and platform to address endemic inequities in maternal-child mortality and food insecurity levels, it lacks focus on maternal-child health and nutrition. Therefore, our partnership with Nevada Partners, Inc. is well-placed for promoting the maternal-child component within West Las Vegas Promise Neighborhood and advancing implementation and equity research. Our community-based participatory approach will use a racial equity framework to co-create WITH the community an intervention to integrate maternal-child health and nutrition consisted of a bundle of effective food security interventions retrieved from the literature (e.g., universal screening, community referral, monitoring system, and nutrition-focused counseling strategies) adapted and integrated into the nurturing care services within West Las Vegas Promise Neighborhood communities. A Hybrid Type III quasi-experimental within-site will be designed to 1) develop and implement an equity-focused system-level intervention to integrate maternal-child health and nutrition and 2) assess the effectiveness of this intervention in decreasing levels of food insecurity and/or improve health outcomes of pregnant women and their young children under the age of 3, which will nurture their potentials, enabling them to thrive. This project is designed to inform how best multi-sectoral interventions (maternal-child health and food insecurity interventions) can be integrated to promote transformation on the maternal-child health and nutrition of historically marginalized communities.",5,5U01HD115256-03,RFA-RM-21-022,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,6,5,3,2

Dynamic control of enhancer repertoires drives stage-specific transcription during tissue development and disease progression. The overall objective of our research program is to gain a fundamental understanding of the regulations of enhancer dynamics in response to signaling and their effects on gene regulation, leading to innovative approaches to the prevention and treatment of enhancer-related diseases. We propose the following two themes to pursue this objective from multiple levels: from the enhancer chromatin organization, to the coordination of enhanceosome components, and the molecular interactions that drive enhancer assembly. Supported by the NIGMS R01 grant (R01GM137009) and other grants, we have made significant progress in both themes, and the results gained from our previous studies form the strong foundation of this MIRA research program. Theme 1: To profile the context-specific enhancer dynamics and understand its functional significance. Our previous studies have revealed that enhancer dynamics can be induced by 1) acute hormone stimulations, which can build up the active enhancer machinery in just minutes at many chromatin sites to turn on gene expression, and 2) chronic disease progression towards tamoxifen resistance, which reprograms the ERα cistrome to evade endocrine therapies in breast cancer. With these two established model systems (acute and chronic signaling), we will 1) capture the dynamic enhancer chromatin organization with multi-omics analyses and identify candidate key transcription factors associated with enhancer reprogramming using bioinformatic approaches; 2) define stage-specific enhanceosome components using in vivo proximity-dependent biotin labeling BioID/TurboID technologies; and 3) introduce a series of perturbations to understand how disruption of enhancer dynamics affects transcriptional activation and cell state. Theme 2: To decipher interand intra-molecular interactions of enhancer components and their contributions to enhancer assembly. Enhancer activation relies on proper enhancer assembly, but the molecular mechanisms of enhancer assembly (how protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions occur) are unclear. We have revealed important principles of enhancer assembly, including combinatorial interactions of multiple transcription factors on hormone-regulated enhancers, and phase-separated condensation mediated by hormone receptor multivalent interactions. Further studies will employ a diverse set of genetic and genomic approaches, as well as our recently established imaging-based approaches, including the LacO arrays/LacIfluorescence proteins system and a single-molecular tracking (single-molecular tracking) imaging system. Specifically, we plan to 1) investigate the behaviors of homotypic and heterotypic multivalent interactions of enhanceosome components and their contributions to enhancer assembly; and 2) dissect the intra-molecular interactions of hormone receptors in response to ligand binding and their roles in regulating enhancer assembly and activity.",1,1R35GM153228-01,PAR-22-180,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,10,10,2,0

The longterm goal of this project is to develop an innovative biologic therapy to improve meniscus tear healing for the prevention of posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Our laboratory has demonstrated the efficacy of utilizing cartilage-derived progenitor cells (cartilage-derived progenitor cells) to stimulate healing of meniscal tears in a small animal model. In efforts to translate our success in small animals to a clinically relevant large animal model, we will optimize and implement a bioactive tear interfacing fibrin hydrogel (fibrin hydrogel) that is laden with cartilage-derived progenitor cells and infused with the chemokine Stromal Cell Derived Factor1 (Stromal Cell Derived Factor1) and the small molecule Kartogenin (Kartogenin), which collectively increases CPC retention at the tear site and increases their chondrogenic matrix synthesis, respectively. The objectives of the proposed study are: To optimize fibrin hydrogel as a novel biologic therapy for meniscus tear repair;  To determine its efficacy for stimulating tear reunification and reduction of posttraumatic osteoarthritis severity; and  To collect biocompatibility data throughout the study to aid in clinical translation of this technology. There are three independent specific aims: (I) Optimize cellular and bioactive components of fibrin hydrogel to produce robust fibrocartilage matrix re-synthesis to bridge and reunify meniscus tears; (II) Evaluate the efficacy of using fibrin hydrogel for improving meniscal fibrocartilage healing in a preclinical large animal model; and (III) Determine the efficacy of fibrin hydrogel-augmented meniscus repair in attenuating posttraumatic osteoarthritis in the knee. The research design will employ a meniscus tissue explant model to optimize fibrin hydrogel in order to maximize cell retention and chondrogenic matrix re-synthesis at the tear site, as well as increase the strength of tissue reintegration/reunion at the tear site. A porcine model of meniscal injury will be used to examine the shortand long-term efficacy and biocompatibility of fibrin hydrogel. Outcome assessments will include evaluation of meniscus tear healing, evaluation of posttraumatic osteoarthritis severity as determined by biomarker analysis, gait asymmetry analysis, and macroscopic/microscopic assessment of the articular cartilage and synovium following fibrin hydrogel treatment.

The human commensal microbiomes have been shown to have a wide variety of potential health impacts. However, our ability to genetically assay microbes is still limited. Microbiomes are extremely complex and standard short-read sequencing technologies often do not provide sufficient basis for the recovery of relevant genes and organisms. Low-input and low-cost linked-read DNA sequencing technologies, such as the 10x Genomics chromium system, have recently emerged with unprecedented promise for de novo assembly of whole genome or metagenome samples. These technologies employ a novel molecular barcoding technique which offers long-range information over standard high-throughput short read, next-generation sequencing, while still at reasonable reagent and low-costs. We plan to develop several innovative novel algorithms to fully leverage barcoded reads in a fast manner to improve several integral and challenging applications, in particular: improving metagenome assembly and leveraging the increased sensitivity to low abundance genomic information in order to identify clinically relevant and potentially pathogenic organisms that can inform clinical decisions. All our proposed methods and computational tools will be made freely available with extensive documentations for the community to use. To ensure the utility of our methods we plan to extensively apply them to a wide range of research and clinical shotgun metagenome data sets, in my laboratory and through various established local, external and industrial collaborations. We also plan to collect control samples and sequence them using multiple platforms (Illumina, 10x Genomics, Loop Genomics Read Cloud, UTS TELL-SEQ, Oxford Nanopore) for benchmarking. We will also use our proposed methods to improve the detection and classification of low abundance organisms in clinical samples.

However the exact nature of interactions between innate immune cells in the regulation of the mucosal barrier is still poorly understood. This proposal will incorporate a team of investigators with diverse and complementary expertise to investigate the mechanisms of innate immune cross-talk in the regulation of mucosal barrier function. The single layer of epithelial cells lining the GI tract is the most fundamental element of the mucosal barrier while macrophages play a key role in mucosal barrier homeostasis and in immunity to intestinal pathogens. Previous studies of communication between these intestinal epithelial cells (intestinal epithelial cells) have focused on unidirectional macrophage regulation of epithelial function. However, we believe that this view is overly simplistic and that a more complex regulatory circuit exists. We hypothesize that bidirectional cross-talk circuits between epithelial cells and macrophages play a key role in both homeostatic regulation of epithelial permeability and macrophage polarization. Here, we will investigate the molecular nature of bidirectional crosstalk circuits between epithelial cells and macrophages with the overall objective to identify how the cell-intrinsic activity of an essential protein tyrosine phosphatase (the cell-intrinsic activity of an essential protein tyrosine phosphatase) regulates molecular changes in one cell type, which can in turn modify the functional capacity of the other. We will test our hypothesis in 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1 will address how the cell-intrinsic activity of an essential protein tyrosine phosphatase modulates the monocyte differentiation continuum and macrophage polarization status in mucosal homeostasis vs. local inflammation in the intestine. Aim 2 will utilize adoptive transfer experiments to identify how the cell-intrinsic activity of an essential protein tyrosine phosphatase deletion in macrophages vs. intestinal epithelial cells modulates intestinal permeability and antimicrobial responsiveness of both cell types in vivo and in vitro. Aim 3 will identify molecular mechanisms by which the cell-intrinsic activity of an essential protein tyrosine phosphatase regulates how these cell types cross-communicate with each other. We have established novel mouse lines and in vitro co-culture model systems for this study. We will use these model systems in a series of innovative and established approaches, to allow us to mechanistically define phosphatase regulation of these fundamental interactions between macrophages and epithelial cells in the regulation of mucosal barrier function and macrophage polarization.

These experiments are foundationally linked to prior work but unequivocally represent an exciting new direction that synergizes the expertise of the investigative team.

However, many patients are resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors or acquire resistance within the first few months of treatment. Interestingly, histological staining of treated tumors reveals a small but consistent population of cells in the proliferative phase of the cell cycle-a phenomenon we refer to as fractional resistance. It is critical to understand the mechanistic basis for fractional resistance because the precise fraction of proliferating tumor cells (e.g., 2% versus 15%) is a strong predictor of patient outcomes. Recent single-cell studies have shown that individual cells can take distinct trajectories, or ""paths"", through the cell cycle that are defined by a unique combination of molecular states over time. We hypothesize that fractional resistance in breast tumors occurs because cells can take multiple paths through the cell cycle, but only some of these paths are sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a powerful new method to profile >50 cell cycle regulator proteins in single cells. By linking single-cell states together, computationally, this approach has revealed how individual cells take alternate paths to evade cell cycle-targeted therapy. In Aim 1, we will induce fractional resistance in a panel of breast tumor models by applying increasing doses of CDK4/6 inhibitors and endocrine therapy to gradually eliminate subpopulations of proliferating tumor cells, thereby defining the range of molecular states cells can reach under drug treatment. Preliminary work suggests that resistant cells must take a particular set of paths at the G1/S transition characterized by high ratios of cyclins (e.g., cyclin D/E) to CDK inhibitors (e.g., p21/p27); altered CDT1 expression; and elevated E2F1 levels. We will validate these predictions through time-lapse microscopy. Aim 2 will take an unbiased approach to determine changes to the global protein landscape in response to increasing doses of endocrine/CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. Using deep, quantitative proteomics that combines massive offline peptide fractionation with tandem mass tag labeling, we will determine changes to the protein landscape in response to CDK4/6 inhibition; validate these changes biochemically and by imaging; and determine the impact of the molecular state changes on sensitivity or resistance to endocrine/CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. New preliminary results show multiple candidate regulators (e.g., CDKN3, UHRF1) that are cell cycle - dependent or expressed in fractionally resistant subpopulations. Aim 3 will identify resistant paths in resected human tumors-a technique developed by our surgical team. In addition, we will test the fractional resistance hypothesis in three ER+/HER2PDX models to assess the extent of fractional resistance in long term, physiologically relevant model. Overall, this project will provide new knowledge in how heterogeneity in cell cycle behaviors leads to fractional drug resistance in ER+/HER2tumors; identify novel resistance factors; and pave the way for the development of next-generation biomarkers that capture the unique cell cycle behaviors and drug sensitivities in other cancer types.",1,1R01CA280482-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Immunotherapy with anti-GD2 is utilized both during upfront therapy and for patients who have relapsed. Despite the availability of these important drugs, approximately 50% of Neuroblastoma patients relapse and eventually die from their disease. Those patients who survive are left with debilitating long-term effects, including growth retardation, hearing loss, infertility, and even secondary malignancies. Many of these secondary effects derive from high dose chemotherapy, while immunotherapy carries a much lower risk of long-term effects. Thus, enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy for Neuroblastoma could potentially cure more patients while causing fewer debilitating late effects in survivors. This proposal pairs expertise in both antibody and chimeric antigen receptor (chimeric antigen receptor) T cell immunotherapy with biological insights into immunotherapy target biology and expression. Our broad hypothesis is that heterogeneous and low surface antigen density of GD2 and other targets can limit the efficacy of immunotherapies in Neuroblastoma, but that this can be overcome through therapeutic maneuvers that increase their expression and/or modulate immune cell function. chimeric antigen receptors are synthetic receptors that redirect the specificity of a T cell against a surface molecule expressed on tumor cells. Our laboratories have defined the antigen density threshold for chimeric antigen receptor T cell activity, and have demonstrated that low level expression of target antigens can drive resistance to these immunotherapies. We have successfully reengineered chimeric antigen receptors to lower their activation threshold and enhance chimeric antigen receptor T cell activity at low antigen density. We have also focused on enhancing antibody based immunotherapies in Neuroblastoma focusing on clinically validated anti-GD2 antibodies. We recently discovered that Neuroblastoma cells can lower the density of GD2 on their surface, avoiding immune cell killing. We uncovered the mechanism of GD2 regulation in Neuroblastoma, linked GD2 expression epigenetic cell state, and reversed GD2 downregulation with FDA approved drugs. The work proposed in this renewal application will address the challenges of low target antigen expression to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies in Neuroblastoma. We will test our central hypothesis in three Specific Aims: 1) Define and modulate the GD2 antigen density threshold necessary for therapeutic success of anti-GD2 based immunotherapies; 2) Optimize approaches to deliver chimeric antigen receptor T cells in combination with EZH2 inhibitors to overcome antigen negative/low resistance; 3) Engineer GD2 and B7-H3 chimeric antigen receptor T cells to overcome low target antigen density in Neuroblastoma by utilizing two novel platforms alone or in combination. This project is significant because it will result in new immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatment of children with Neuroblastoma, while also uncovering fundamental mechanisms driving successful immunotherapies that can be broadly applied across many types of cancer. This Project will address a major unmet need for new and effective therapies for children with Neuroblastoma that can cure more patients and reduce the burden of debilitating late effects.",2,2P01CA217959-06A1,PAR-20-077,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,16,0,4,4

The high prevalence of these problems in young people from low-income and ethnic/racial minority groups is of particular concern. This program of research aims to identify multi-level factors influencing a broad range of weight-related problems throughout key stages of the life course to guide the development of highly innovative, culturally acceptable, and effective interventions for populations in greatest need. The focus will be on the transition from adolescence to adulthood, an understudied, but important, period of life for the development of weight problems. This program of research is aimed at achieving the Principal Investigator's vision whereby young people from all backgrounds will have positive weight-related health, with support from their family, friends, schools, worksites, and neighborhoods. This Outstanding Investigator Award (R35-OIA) will support a highly productive and effective researcher and her team in a manner that will promote creativity, allow strategic risk-taking, and have a great impact on weight-related problems. The program of research combines a longstanding and well-defined cohort study with a flexible plan to address emerging topics of interest. The research program builds and expands upon the Project Eating and Activity in Teens and Young Adults (Eating and Activity in Teens and Young Adults) studies, the largest and most comprehensive longitudinal body of research examining multi-level predictors of a broad range of weight-related problems in young people. The research program will include the following: 1) 12-year longitudinal, multi-level follow-up data collection on weight-related problems from a diverse sample of young people (N=2,793) and their family, friend, school, worksite, and neighborhood environments; 2) intermediate and rapid response survey mechanisms to capture short-term changes and assess the impact of societal changes and emerging policies of potential relevance to weight-related outcomes; 3) innovative substudies using multiple methods for in-depth explorations of multi-level etiological processes to guide intervention development; and 4) a mentored training program for new investigators who will shape the future of the field of young adult weight-related health. This OIA comprehensive program of research will lead to the development of multi-level explanatory models for weight-related problems in young people and interventions for populations at greatest risk. Integration of a strong training program will ensure that the next generation of public health professionals has the tools to prevent marginalized populations from continuing to carry the burden of weight-related problems.

Loss of genomic integrity contributes to the development of most cancers. DNA double strand breaks (double strand breaks) are a dangerous type of DNA damage that can lead to rapid loss of sequence information stored within the genome. Homologous recombination (Homologous recombination) is one of the primary DSB repair pathways and is predicated on locating an undamaged DNA sequence that matches the damaged DNA sequence elsewhere in the genome. The homologous sequence can then be used to restore the lost DNA sequence information. During normal mitotic growth, Homologous recombination preferentially repairs double strand breaks using sequence information stored in the sister chromatid. Aiding in maintenance of allelic variation between genes and preventing unbalanced exchange of genetic information between chromosomes. In contrast during meiosis the homologous chromosome becomes the preferred DNA repair substrate. There is a large amount information on existing pathways that have evolved in S. cerevisiae to promote DNA repair from the homologous chromosome during meiosis. However, little is known about how homologous chromosomes are used for repair in humans. One of the key determinants in chromosome choice during Homologous recombination, is the organization of the presynaptic complex (presynaptic complex). The regulation, formation, and activity of the human presynaptic complex is controlled by >45 proteins. However, a basic functional unit of the presynaptic complex consists of RAD51 and associated factors (RAD54L) during mitosis, and RAD51, DMC1 and their associated factors (RAD54L, RAD54B, HOP2-MND1) during meiosis. Understanding how these proteins organize into active complexes during Homologous recombination is a critical step in understanding how human homologous chromosomes are used for Homologous recombination. Over the course of our studies we will use biochemical and single molecule approaches to understand the mechanism behind RAD51 and DMC1 self-segregation during meiotic presynaptic complex formation. We will understand how DMC1 forms a meiotic homology search complex, and with cooperation of accessory proteins, aligns DNA sequences. We will identify how meiotic homology search complexes overcome chromatin. Finally, we will work to understand how conflicts between the two highly related motor protein RAD54L and RAD54B may promote homologous chromosome use during human mitotic Homologous recombination. In summary, the primary goal of this research proposal will be to use molecular biology, biochemistry, and single molecule approaches to understand how human mitotic and meiotic presynaptic complexs organize, and promote DNA sequence alignment during Homologous recombination. The data we collect from these experiments will be used to build a model for how human homologous chromosome selection may occur during both mitotic and meiotic Homologous recombination.",5,5R35GM142457-04,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,10,10,2,4

Although direct joint injury and excessive mechanical overloading are considered as important contributors to the development of Osteoarthritis, only approximately 12% of the overall prevalence of symptomatic Osteoarthritis is attributable to posttraumatic Osteoarthritis of the hip, knee, or ankle. Aging is recognized as the most important risk factor for Osteoarthritis, and the metabolic phenotype becomes the second most frequent subtype of Osteoarthritis among patients enrolled in clinical studies. Recently, it has been recognized that cellular senescence is a key driver for the progression of post-traumatic Osteoarthritis. However, whether and how senescent cells (senescent cells) are involved in the development of non-traumatic Osteoarthritis remain poorly understood. In our preliminary study, we found accumulated senescent cells at the joint subchondral bone marrow of both spontaneous aging Osteoarthritis mice and STR/Ort mice, a spontaneous Osteoarthritis mice associated with metabolic dysregulation. Increased senescent cells were not detected in subchondral bone marrow of a post-traumatic Osteoarthritis mice. Therefore, subchondral bone marrow cell senescence may represent a unique feature of non-traumatic subtype of Osteoarthritis distinguishable from post-traumatic Osteoarthritis. Moreover, we identified that close to 80% of the senescent cells are bone marrow Pre-osteoclast (Pre-osteoclast). Pre-osteoclasts isolated from old mice, relative to young mice, had increased expression of common senescence-associated secretory phenotype (senescence-associated secretory phenotype) factors and much higher expression of angiogenesis factor PDGF-BB, a potent angiogenesis factor. It is known that increased subchondral bone angiogenesis is a major contributor to the development of Osteoarthritis. Therefore, the excessive PDGF-BB secreted by subchondral bone marrow senescent cells may contribute to aberrant subchondral bone angiogenesis. Our central hypothesis is that senescent Pre-osteoclasts induce aberrant subchondral bone angiogenesis by secreting excessive PDGF-BB, leading to Osteoarthritis-related joint structural damage. The hypothesis will be tested by the following Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will trace the senescent cells in synovial tissue, articular cartilage, and subchondral bone tissue of the joints by detecting the cellular senescence markers in spontaneous aging Osteoarthritis mice and STR/Ort mice. We will also trace the senescent cells at different stages of OC lineage and verify the senescence-associated secretory phenotype phenotype of the cells in bone marrow of the mice. Aim 2 will examine the necessity and sufficiency of Pre-osteoclasts-derived PDGF-BB in age-associated subchondral bone angiogenesis and Osteoarthritis development. In Aim 3, we will first define the contribution of cellular senescence to subchondral bone angiogenesis and osteogenesis by selectively eliminating the senescent cells in Osteoarthritis mice. We will then test if blockage of Pre-osteoclast senescence using both genetic and pharmacologic approaches attenuates Osteoarthritis progression.",5,5P01AG066603-04,PAR-19-314,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,15,2,0,0
10760306,https:/reporter.nih.gov/search/znadiKrmIkm0UaujO0_yag/project-details/10760306#similar-Projects,Mechanisms of RNA polymerase II transcription regulation,"ABSTRACT Our research program combines detailed biochemical reconstitution experiments with powerful cell-based assays, with a goal of gaining fundamental mechanistic insights about RNA polymerase II (polymerase II) function and its regulation. The 12-subunit human polymerase II enzyme transcribes all protein-coding and many non-coding RNAs in the human genome. Pol II transcription initiation is regulated by the 4.0 MDa Pre-Initiation Complex (Pre-Initiation Complex), which contains TFIIA, IIB, IID, IIE, IIF, IIH, polymerase II, and Mediator. Together with sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors (transcription factors), the Pre-Initiation Complex helps direct the timing, location, and direction of polymerase II transcription, genomewide. How transcription factors and the Pre-Initiation Complex work together during different stages of polymerase II transcription (e.g. initiation, pausing, elongation) remain incompletely understood; moreover, new insights over the past 5+ years have transformed our understanding of transcription. For instance, enhancer RNA (enhancer RNA) transcription and enhancer-promoter communication appear to drive lineageor signal-specific (or oncogenic) gene expression programs, and liquid phase separated molecular condensates correlate with polymerase II activity in cells. Although new mechanistic models have emerged, such models cannot be reliably tested using only cell-based methods, in part because of the enormous complexity of cellular systems. For instance, the identity and concentration of the proteins, nucleic acids, and biochemicals that are present at any given gene in a population of cells cannot possibly be defined. In the next 5 years, we propose to leverage our unique expertise in biochemical reconstitution with cuttingedge cellular methods to address the following high-impact areas: 1) Liquid phase-separated molecular condensates and polymerase II function. We seek to define how (or whether) molecular condensates regulate transcription, including whether distinct compositions help control different stages of polymerase II transcription (e.g. initiation vs. elongation). 2) Regulation of polymerase II initiation, pausing, and elongation by the transcriptional kinases CDK7 (TFIIH subunit), CDK8 (Mediator-associated kinase), and CDK9 (P-TEFb kinase). We will assess what each kinase, alone and in combination with the others, contributes to the regulation of polymerase II activity. This will include potential ""downstream"" impacts on elongation rates or RNA processing. 3) Enhancer RNA (enhancer RNA) transcription and super-enhancer function. We will dissect the mechanistic requirements for bidirectional enhancer RNA transcription, to determine whether they are distinct from typical protein-coding genes. Furthermore, we seek to reconstitute super-enhancer function in vitro, which would serve as a framework for understanding the ""rules"" by which super-enhancers drive high-level transcription in human cells. (Although this aspect is ambitious, we note our recent success with reconstitution of polymerase II promoter-proximal pausing, which the field long considered difficult if not impossible.) Finally, we emphasize that an equally important aspect of our research plan is to rigorously test the models that emerge from our detailed and systematic in vitro assays through targeted, follow-up cellbased assays, which will implement genome-editing, chemical biology, transcriptomics, and other approaches.",5,5R35GM139550-04,PAR-19-367,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,10,10,2,0

A century of research using many experimental organisms, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, defined key intercellular signals regulating germline development, delineated central players in meiosis, and revealed the importance of post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms. Yet, important mechanistic questions remain about how intercellular communication integrates the underlying molecular mechanisms into a coherent germline developmental program. This research proposal addresses several central questions: •How do soma-germline gap junctions orchestrate germline development, coordinate germline developmental subroutines, and integrate nutritional signals to optimize reproduction? •How do intercellular signals and gametic interactions regulate protein translation to enable fertilization and ensure the vitality of the embryo? •Can we exploit the dynamic nature of germline development in which germ cell nuclei move within the gonadal tube to provide broad insights into the cell biology of diseases affecting the nuclear envelope? Goals: The chief goal of our work is to delineate the regulatory networks governing conserved and essential steps in germline development. Our focus will be on three areas:  The role of gap junctions in controlling soma-germline interactions;  The regulation of protein translation by intercellular signaling during oocyte meiotic maturation and the oocyte-to-embryo transition; and  Studies in the C. elegans germline system that provide insights into the cell biology of a class of human diseases affecting the nuclear envelope. In pursuing these goals, we will fill three key gaps in understanding: (i) the nature of the active biomolecules that transit through gap junctions to mediate their many essential reproductive functions; (ii) the function and regulation of a large translational regulatory machine that lies at the heart of the oocyte meiotic maturation decision and the oocyte-to-embryo transition; and (iii) the involvement of nuclear mechanotransduction and endogenous mechanical forces in the origin of diseases affecting the nuclear envelope. Vision: Using the powerful combination of genetic and modern molecular technologies available in C. elegans, we will advance our understanding of germline development, germline stem cell behavior, and oogenesis. In the course of these investigations, we will discover new molecular principles vital to human health and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat disease.

Therefore, there is a critical unmet need for new treatment options. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells have led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of some hematologic cancers, but efficacy in solid tumors remains limited, partly due to the lack of highly specific targets and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (tumor microenvironment). Moreover, the time required and the high cost of manufacturing an autologous cell product, and the toxicity of CAR-T cells call for novel products that are universal, safe, and potent. CAR-NK cells have emerged as a promising cell therapy for cancer due to the NK cells' innate ability to kill tumor cells and their safety in the allogeneic setting. In a first-in-human study, our group showed the safety and efficacy of cord blood (CB)-derived CAR-NK cells targeting CD19 in B-lymphoid malignancies. This proposal aims to build on this platform to develop the next-generation NK cell therapies for Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by enhancing NK cell potency and persistence through optimal co-stimulatory signaling, cytokine armoring and checkpoint inhibition. We have identified TROP2 as a promising therapeutic target in Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and developed a novel strategy to target TROP2 by genetically modifying CB-NK cells with a retroviral vector encoding: (i) the humanized RS7 scFv targeting TROP2; (ii) DAP10 as an NKspecific co-stimulatory domain; (iii) IL-15 to support their survival and proliferation; and (iv) inducible caspase-9 (inducible caspase-9) as a safety switch (inducible caspase-9/TROP2CAR/IL-15). Our data show the efficacy and safety of this approach in vitro and in vivo and support its translation to the clinic. In addition, we have developed a robust strategy for the cryopreservation of CAR-NK cells, enabling the generation of a biobank of off-the-shelf engineered NK cells that could be thawed and infused at bedside, thus reducing cost and increasing accessibility. We have manufactured and cryopreserved 125 patient doses of GMP-grade inducible caspase-9/TROP2CAR/IL-15 NK cells and a clinical study to test the safety and efficacy of this off-the-shelf product in Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was recently approved by the FDA (Protocol 20220687; IND 29348). Finally, we have devised a novel strategy to target the immune metabolic checkpoint CREM to modulate the metabolic fitness and potency of CAR-NK cells in the Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumor microenvironment. We hypothesize that targeting TROP2 with inducible caspase-9/TROP2CAR/IL-15 NK cells will greatly improve outcomes in Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and that by deleting the metabolic immune checkpoint CREM we can further enhance the fitness and potency of NK cells. We will test our hypothesis in three specific aims: In Aim 1 we will conduct a Phase I/II clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of intraperitoneally delivered inducible caspase-9/TROP2CAR/IL-15 NK cells in patients with TROP2+ Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In Aim 2 we will apply innovative single-cell transcriptomics and spatial proteomics to comprehensively characterize the fate of the adoptively transferred CAR-NK cells and their interaction with other cells within the tumor microenvironment, to uncover key mechanisms of efficacy and resistance. In Aim 3 we will investigate the mechanism by which targeting CREM enhances the antitumor activity of inducible caspase-9/TROP2CAR/IL-15 NK cells in an orthotopic PDX mouse model of Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.",1,1R01CA288617-01,PAR-21-033,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,16,0,4,4

About 95% Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients harbor oncogenic mutant KRAS (KRAS*) that promotes pancreatic carcinogenesis and is required for Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma maintenance. Given that KRAS* can be druggable now, therapy resistance occurs in several pre-clinical models and clinical trials, suggesting that therapy combination is required to achieve durable disease control. Targeting KRAS* results in enrichment of tumor associated macrophages (tumor associated macrophages) in pancreatic, colon and lung cancer models, offering opportunities for chimeric antigen receptor (chimeric antigen receptor) macrophage (Mφ) therapy and for Mφ-mediated cancer-specific delivery of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, transplanted Mφs were prone to accumulate in liver, lung, and spleen despite that most of the remaining Mφs were localized in tumors, rising safety concerns that might be addressed by conditional gene expression systems. The hypothesis is that tumor-conditionally expressed cytokine armored chimeric antigen receptor Mφs (ca-chimeric antigen receptor-Ms) may synergize with KRAS* inhibitors (KRAS* inhibitors) to effectively suppress primary tumor growth, metastasis, and tumor recurrence and to prolong survival in Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma spontaneous metastasis mouse models. A successful outcome of proposed study will generate the first ca-chimeric antigen receptor-M therapy for Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treatment, pave the way for clinical trials in KRAS* Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients and provide applicable methods to develop ca-chimeric antigen receptor-Ms for other Mφ-enriched cancers. Aim 1. Optimize cell culture and engineering platforms for adoptive macrophage therapy. Primary Mφs are non-proliferative in vitro, and accumulation of donor Mφs in healthy organs is a latent safety risk. Aim 1a will enable in vitro expansion of Mφs by genetic or chemical screening of Mφ self-renewal regulators. Aim 1b will limit off-tumor activity of donor Mφs by employing dual oxygen-sensing switch and identifying TAM-specific genes versus tissue-resident Mφs, whose promoter/enhancers will be used for tumor-specific gene expression. Aim 2. Design chimeric antigen receptor Mφs to target Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The comprehensive chimeric antigen receptor optimization for effective antigen-specific activation of phagocytosis and cytotoxicity in Mφs is lacking. Aim 2a will design and optimize constituent protein domains of chimeric antigen receptor to direct Mφ activities against Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Aim 2b will determine the tumoricidal effect of chimeric antigen receptor-Ms as an adjuvant therapy of KRAS* inhibitors in Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models. Aim 2c will dissect mechanisms how chimeric antigen receptor activation reprograms Mφ transcription, secretion, and pathway transduction to elicit tumoricidal effect. Aim 3. Engineer conditionally armored Mφs to trigger tumoricidal immunity. Mφs are tumor-homing, so delivery of pro-inflammatory cytokines by Mφs may reduce systemic toxicity while elicit strong anti-tumor immune response. Aim 3a will develop safe and effective cytokine armored Mφ therapy by cytokine screening and employing conditional transgene expression system. Aim 3b will assess tumoricidal activity of Mφs engineered by the optimal chimeric antigen receptor construct, the top cytokine candidate or both as an adjuvant therapy of KRAS* inhibitors in various Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models. Aim 3c will delineate the role of cytokine armored Mφs in the tumor microenvironment remodeling by single cell RNA sequencing and immunophenotyping.",5,5R01CA275761-02,PAR-21-038,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Sitka Tribe of Alaska has organized an environmental monitoring program and seafood safety testing program along with other regional partners (called SEATOR: Southeast Alaska Tribal Ocean Research) to reduce the burden of Paralytic shellfish poisoning disease in Southeast Alaska. This grant seeks to augment SEATOR's ongoing efforts, through additional data collection and partnerships with the Sitka School District and Emory University. Collecting additional years of Paralytic shellfish poisoning toxin monitoring data using the same protocols as today will allow a timeseries analysis to inform a cutting-edge forecasting model that will give Southeast Alaska residents warning of especially risky subsistence shellfish harvest times, and thereby prevent poisonings. Collecting new data on specific kinds of Paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (rather than only measuring the presence or absence of any Paralytic shellfish poisoning toxin) can clarify which other settings around the world are most similar (e.g., by comparing toxin profiles). This is important because Paralytic shellfish poisoning is a global health problem and there are other locations that could benefit from an informative prediction model, or that might be able to provide useful information for developing this region's model.

Engaging in physical activity (physical activity) may help to counteract these negative consequences. Youth with the Fontan circulation engage in less physical activity (physical activity) than their peers and demonstrate decreased aerobic performance and lower skeletal muscle mass portending worse clinical outcomes. We now know that patients with the Fontan circulation can safely engage in physical activity and improve their aerobic exercise performance in hospital-based exercise programs. Unfortunately, these programs are highly selective, costly, and inconvenient, and thus not generalizable or equitable. Digital health applications can mitigate these barriers by remotely promoting physical activity beyond the point of care, especially with caregiver support. However, gaps in knowledge remain about whether a home-based digital intervention can 1) increase physical activity and 2) improve aerobic performance and increase skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength, in youth with the Fontan circulation. Thirdly, from an equity standpoint, it is not known how individual, family and neighborhood level factors influence the effectiveness of a home-based physical activity intervention. Thus, there is a critical need to develop and test innovative digital interventions to improve physical activity and clinical outcomes among all youth with the Fontan circulation. The study team's objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a digital intervention to increase physical activity and clinically relevant measures of physical fitness in youth with the Fontan circulation. To accomplish this, the team proposes a randomized controlled trial with three specific aims. A wrist-worn physical activity tracker will be given to all participants, but they will be randomized to ""enhanced usual care"" (tracker plus standard encouragement to exercise) or a digital physical activity intervention for 6-months. The intervention arm will include:  personalized aerobic-based physical activity,  personalized resistance exercise sessions, and  financial and non-financial engagement strategies, targeting youth and caregivers. These intervention components will be delivered using an advanced mobile health informatics platform. Clinical assessments will be made at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Under aim 1, we will determine if the multi-component digital intervention increases physical activity levels in youth with the Fontan circulation. Under aim 2, we will determine if the intervention leads to improvements in physical fitness outcomes (aerobic capacity, muscle mass, and strength). Finally, under aim 3, we will test whether medical, neurodevelopmental, sociodemographic and/or neighborhood factors, are associated with the efficacy of the digital intervention, using qualitative and quantitative approaches. It is anticipated that the digital intervention will significantly increase physical activity and improve physical fitness. Further, multi-level factors will be identified that associate with the efficacy of the intervention, thus providing the foundation for future implementation trials. These findings will lead to the integration of equitable and sustainable digital physical activity interventions for youth with a Fontan circulation in the pediatric cardiology clinical setting.",1,1R61HL171110-01A1,PAR-22-189,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",1,3,3,2

We previously found that the BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib (A) and the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax (V) are highly effective at killing chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells ex vivo. We developed AVO, a new time-limited triplet combination regimen combining AV with an anti-CD20 antibody obinutuzumab (O). The AVO clinical trial and correlative laboratory studies on primary samples from this trial comprise the key elements of this project. The first aim of the project is to determine the efficacy of the AVO combination regimen in patients with previously untreated TP53 aberrant chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We hypothesize that AVO will be a highly efficacious and welltolerated novel agent triplet regimen, with individualized therapy duration guided by achievement of undetectable minimal residual disease (undetectable minimal residual disease). This hypothesis will be tested through determining the proportion of patients who achieve complete response (complete response) with undetectable minimal residual disease, as well as characterizing the safety of the regimen, in an investigator-initiated, phase 2, multicenter clinical trial of AVO in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The second aim of the project is to assess whether MRD clonal dynamics, pre-treatment mitochondrial priming, or genomic complexity predict clinical response to AVO. We will utilize a next-generation sequencing (next-generation sequencing) based technology, Adaptive ClonoSEQ, to assess whether MRD clonal dynamics with this assay can more accurately predict survival and guide treatment duration decisions compared with conventional flow cytometrybased MRD. Through functional interrogation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell mitochondria by BH3 profiling, we hypothesize that patients with higher levels of mitochondrial priming at baseline and/or early on treatment will achieve a higher rate of complete response with undetectable minimal residual disease on AVO. Genomic predictors of response will also be assessed through stimulated karyotype and mutational profiling with a 95-gene next-generation sequencing 'rapid heme panel' (rapid heme panel'). The third aim of the project is to elucidate mechanisms of resistance to AVO, including acquired somatic mutations, modulation in mitochondrial priming, alterations in phosphorylation, and kinase activity. We will use rapid heme panel' to evaluate the pattern of somatic mutations as they develop. We will also evaluate whether chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells that are typically dependent on BCL-2 at baseline will develop alternative survival dependencies on other antiapoptotic proteins at progression. In addition, we will assess whether BCL-2 family protein phosphorylation may represent a functional resistance mechanism, and whether PP2A activators can help reverse this and thereby restore sensitivity. And we will use high-throughput kinase activity mapping (high-throughput kinase activity mapping) to identify which kinases are activated in resistant patients to identify new, potentially therapeutically actionable targets. Elucidating resistance mechanisms will inform the design of future novel agent combination therapy trials, with the goal of decreasing the risk of acquired therapy resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and eventually other B cell malignancies.",5,5R01CA266298-03,PAR-21-033,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,16,0,4,4

Within this milieu, Veillonella, an anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterium, stands out for its unique ability to produce heme. Although this process seems non-essential for Veillonella itself, it's critical for its bacterial associates. Despite its significance, the regulation of heme production in Veillonella and its impact on oral ecology remain enigmatic. This study zeroes in on the symbiotic dance between Veillonella and the periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (Porphyromonas gingivalis), which relies heavily on heme as its primary nutrient and is known to provoke inflammation via red blood cell breakdown. In the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, heme production in Veillonella is significantly induced. Intriguingly, this heme production completely abolishes Porphyromonas gingivalis's hemolytic activity. This initial observation propels the hypothesis that Veillonella's heme production might strategically temper Porphyromonas gingivalis's hemolytic behaviors, presenting a delicate balance with boarder implications for Porphyromonas gingivalis-associated oral health. To rigorously dissect this interplay, we've delineated two central aims. 1) Explore Mechanisms by which Veillonella Inhibits Porphyromonas gingivalis hemolysis. This will involve a comprehensive assay to discern the role of potential proteases produced by Veillonella in suppressing Porphyromonas gingivalis's hemolytic attributes, with RNA-seq analysis and transposon screening leading to a thorough insight. 2) Ascertain how the regulation of the heme biosynthesis in Veillonella by Porphyromonas gingivalis and its role in Porphyromonas gingivalis-host interaction. Given the significance of Veillonella' heme production, understanding its regulation and impact on Porphyromonas gingivalis's interaction with the host immune system is pivotal. This objective will use transwell assays, luciferase reporter strains, Tn5 transposon library and in vitro tissue assays to provide a comprehensive view. In essence, this research aspires to shed light on the nuances of oral biofilm ecology, emphasizing the yet-to be-explored realm of Veillonella's heme production. Unveiling the potential natural mechanism where one bacterium regulates another's inflammatory actions, our study could pave the way for innovative periodontal treatments and a deeper grasp of dental biofilm interplay.",1,1R21DE034098-01,PA-20-195,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH,7,9,1,3

Adaptation to repeated inflammatory stimuli may be critical in preventing rejection of the fetus by the exaggerated maternal inflammatory responses to mild/moderate infections that are common during human pregnancy. Immune tolerance/adaptation is a well-described phenomenon in which cells exposed to repeated pathogens become less responsive to subsequent exposures. This adaptation suppresses an overly aggressive inflammatory response to repeated infections that can be detrimental to the tissues rather than protective. Dampened immune response to repeated infections has been associated with protection against tissue injury and mortality in several human diseases. However, to date, the role of immune tolerance to repeated infections in the context of human pregnancy, and the exact mechanisms that contribute to the establishment of such immune adaptation to prevent inflammation-induced pathologic pregnancies are not explored. There is now extensive evidence that miRNAs play an important role in the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy, with a wide range of miRNAs implicated in endometrial receptivity, implantation, gestational tissues function, and labor. Our preliminary results indicate that repeated LPS (gram negative bacterial toxins) or LTA (gram-positive bacterial toxins) exposures to human placenta attenuates exaggerated inflammatory responses known to contribute to inflammation-associated pathologic pregnancies. Our data also point to the involvement of a humanand placenta-specific miRNA called miRNA-519c-3p (miRNA-519c-3p) in the development of placental immune tolerance. Our overriding hypothesis is that repeated exposure of the placenta to pathogens induces a tolerant phenotype mediated by the miRNA-519c-3p to guard the maternal-fetal interface from the exaggerated inflammation associated with pathologic pregnancies. We hypothesize that LPS/LTA induce placental trophoblasts to secrete miRNA-519c-3p packaged within placental extracellular vesicles for delivery to nearby or distant cells. The miRNA-519c-3p within the EVs will mediate down-regulation of exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses associated with repeated bacterial toxin exposures. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Investigate the role of miRNA-519c-3p in mediating immune adaptation in the human placenta after repeated infections and Aim 2: Investigate the molecular mechanisms of placental miRNA-519c-3p mediating immune adaptation. These studies will set the stage for future experiments to test if decreased expression of miRNA-519c-3p is linked to inflammation-associated pathologic pregnancies. This unique humanand placenta-specific miRNA-519c-3p can be an excellent biomarker candidate as well as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases of pregnancy.",5,5R01HD098258-06,PA-19-056,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,1,3,3,2

Project 3's aims are 1) to compare the substitution between different tobacco/nicotine products as a function of tobacco-user type, 2) to model policies that may promote and mitigate illegal tobacco purchases for different types of tobacco users, and 3) to examine the generality of laboratory-based findings and their moderators using diverse samples (US, England, and Canada) from the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project. Participants will be both exclusive cigarette smokers and dual cigarette/nicotine vaping product users because these individuals are most at risk for negative health outcomes associated with combusted tobacco. The methods will employ the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (Experimental Tobacco Marketplace), an online purchasing experience that places a mix of products, prices, and specific regulations under experimental conditions that simulate ""real world"" circumstances. The Experimental Tobacco Marketplace provides estimates of the effects of product changes and/or policy changes on tobacco purchasing patterns, including between-product substitution in different types of tobacco product users. Here the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace will be used to examine the effects of novel products, such as heated tobacco and nicotine pouch products, on purchasing patterns and the uptake of different products (substitution). Further, the Illegal Experimental Tobacco Marketplace (iExperimental Tobacco Marketplace), a methodological extension of the Experimental Tobacco Marketplace, was developed to examine conditions that promote or mitigate against illegal purchases. Here the iExperimental Tobacco Marketplace will be used to examine the effects of regulatory environments that tend to promote illegal purchases, such as high cigarette prices and reduced nicotine content cigarettes. Moreover, this project will examine policy strategies that may mitigate illegal purchases, such as health communications, availability of nicotine replacement therapy, and penalties.

It is also one of the leading causes of cancer death, with approximately 29,430 deaths anticipated in 2018, usually as a result of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer). Pathogenic variants in DNA damage repair (DNA damage repair) pathway genes are prevalent in a substantial subset of men who develop metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. These germline or somatic genetic abnormalities, primarily insertions and deletions resulting in protein truncations that interfere with DNA damage repair, occur in 20-25% of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. While several studies are underway to leverage these findings for men at the latest stages of prostate cancer, genetic variation in the DNA damage repair pathway has not yet been fully characterized for men with localized prostate cancer. While there is increasing evidence that some DNA damage repair gene aberrations may be associated with aggressive prostate cancer, this also has not been fully characterized. In the United States, where prostate cancer screening is common, over 90% of patients present initially with localized disease. It is at this point in the natural history of the disease when intervention can have the most profound impact. Thus, a major focus of this proposal is understanding the spectrum of DNA damage repair gene aberrations that promote aggressive cancers, particularly in men with high-risk localized and oligometastatic disease. Retrospective series demonstrate that DNA damage repair variants occur with low frequency in men with low-risk prostate cancer and with higher frequency in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer. This has wide-ranging clinical implications. For instance, mutational status could be used to identify those at highest risk of developing lethal prostate cancer, and therapy could be optimized based on tumor or germline findings. In addition, targeted screening could be implemented to identify those at highest risk of aggressive disease and provide an opportunity for early intervention. The overarching goal of this program is to increase our understanding of the spectrum of DNA damage repair gene aberrations that are associated with adverse outcomes in high-risk localized and oligometastatic prostate cancer. This will allow us to optimize the therapeutic approach to patients who have DNA damage repair aberrations, to detect and treat lethal disease early, and to improve outcomes for patients and their relatives who carry germline aberrations. In order to achieve our goal, we have assembled a multi-institutional and multidisciplinary group of investigators, including clinical investigators, epidemiologists, statisticians, pathologists, clinical geneticists, computational biologists, bioinformaticians, and basic scientists. Our specific aims are to determine the association between long-term clinical outcome and pathogenic germline and somatic variants in DNA damage repair genes across different ethnic groups, to develop treatment strategies for patients with germline or somatic alterations in DNA damage repair pathways, and to evaluate the functional significance of different alterations in DNA damage repair genes.",5,5P01CA228696-05,PAR-18-290,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

Proteins themselves are often regulated through direct interaction with ligands, including metals, lipids, other proteins, and drugs. These protein-ligand interactions are fundamental to diverse biological processes. Yet, technologies to explore these interactions are limited in terms of both throughput and their ability to scale. The limits of these technologies are in part highlighted be the fact that for nearly 30 years, proteomics and genomics technologies research have been unable to fully characterize the functions of the 20,000 protein coding genes in human cells. To address this, we propose to build a cornerstone technology suite for high-throughput, proteome-wide protein-ligand interaction profiling. In this work we will demonstrate the development and implementation in a focused way to highlight the potential of this technology to bring robust quantitative approaches to study ligand binding at scale. Our technological innovations center on using high-throughput methods to detect proteinligand interactions across the entire proteome in a single analysis. To do this, we will measure the change in thermal stability of proteins induced by binding to a ligand. We measure this thermal stability as a relative difference in protein abundance using sample multiplexing based on tandem mass tags (tandem mass tags). Sample multiplexing enables quantitation of up to 18 samples' proteomes simultaneously. Sample multiplexing with tandem mass tags increases sample throughput, reduces missing values across samples, and enables complex experimental designs - e.g., time courses, dose dependency, and knockout-rescue experiments. Over the course of the proposed work, we will build new proteomics technologies to harness the benefits of proteome-wide thermal stability assays and tandem mass tags quantitation to characterize protein-ligand interactions. The combination of  intelligent mass spectrometric data acquisition,  proteome thermal stability profiling, and  sample multiplexing will enable us to decipher the complex interplay between proteins and ligands across the proteome. With an eye towards translational research, we will focus at first on small-molecule drugs as ligands as we can acquire diverse libraries with known primary protein targets. These data and methods will be used to reveal the functional and secondary effects of ligand perturbation of the proteome by leveraging matched whole proteome and gene expression profiles to determine to what extent specific drug-proteinengagement drives cellular responses.",5,5R35GM150919-02,PAR-20-117,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES,5,14,2,0

In the later stages of Cystic Fibrosis, P. aeruginosa reside in biofilm communities in the lung, accounting for their resistance to antibiotic therapies. To date, little is known about host factors that promote the transition of P. aeruginosa from acute to chronic infection in Cystic Fibrosis. Cystic Fibrosis patients show a reduced ability to clear P. aeruginosa acquired during respiratory viral infections and frequently new pseudomonal colonization in people with Cystic Fibrosis follows a respiratory viral infection. We have shown that virus co-infection, and the subsequent antiviral interferon response, promote biofilm conversion by P. aeruginosa. Interferon has potent antiviral activity, but in addition, interferon stimulated gene (interferon stimulated gene) effector functions have been reported to promote pathogen replication, suggesting that pathogens have evolved to subvert and even benefit from the interferon response. Decades of research demonstrate metabolic reprogramming as part of the host response to acute viral infections, with induction of aerobic glycolysis being a common observation. Our preliminary data suggest that the innate antiviral immune response through IFN signaling induces aerobic glycolysis during RSV infection, while still maintaining oxidative phosphorylation in the respiratory epithelium. Using an improved model to culture P. aeruginosa biofilms in association with human Cystic Fibrosis airway epithelial cells and a RSV mouse infection model, we will examine mechanisms by which antiviral interferon signaling promotes biofilm conversion by P. aeruginosa through a mechanism of metabolic reprogramming. To this end, we will determine how metabolic reprogramming of the respiratory epithelium facilitates viral-bacterial co-infection, define how secreted metabolic products from the virus-infected respiratory epithelium promote P. aeruginosa persistence and chronic infection by impairing antibacterial function in recruited macrophages and promoting bacterial biofilm growth. Our goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism for virus-stimulated bacterial biofilms and thus, identify new targets that could delay acquisition and chronic bacterial colonization, or work in conjunction with existing therapies, to eradicate P. aeruginosa in Cystic Fibrosis patients.",1,1R01HL169973-01A1,PA-20-185,"NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE",7,9,1,3

While the addition of Radiation therapy to surgery over surgery alone significantly prolongs patient survival, all patients with glioblastoma ultimately succumb to the disease and survival times are unacceptably low. So far, the addition of targeted or non-targeted therapies to surgery and Radiation therapy have had limited success and indicate the need for novel strategies against this disease. There is ample evidence supporting the heterogeneity of glioblastoma and the existence of a small population of glioblastoma stem cells (glioblastoma stem cells)), relatively resistant to Radiation therapy and chemotherapy, and able to regrow the tumor. Together, treatment resistant glioblastoma stem cells, dispersion of cancer cells beyond the visible tumor, large areas of hypoxia and the blood-brain-barrier (blood-brain-barrier) add to the challenge glioblastoma presents to cancer therapy. We have previously demonstrated that radiation reactivates stem cell programs causing cellular multipotency and plasticity, followed by the acquisition of an induced GSC state. Importantly, we showed that this process could be targeted and that preventing the induction of glioblastoma stem cells led to improved survival in animal models of glioblastoma. We have now developed novel compounds that cross the blood-brain-barrier and prevent the radiation-induced generation of glioblastoma stem cells. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicate that a radiation-induced multipotent state can be utilized to allow for terminal differentiation of glioblastoma cells. The studies proposed in this application build on these findings and take the research program into this exciting new direction to utilize this induced multipotent state for altering the radiation responses of glioblastoma.",5,5R01CA281682-02,PAR-22-198,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,4,0,4,4

The mechanisms that underlie formation of such cells and their fate remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that empty beta cells, which are invisible to standard insulin immunostaining and potentially also to the immune system, play important roles in the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes while holding therapeutic potential for reversion of diabetes. We propose in depth experiments to characterize empty beta cells, using MACSima ultra high-content immunofluorescence imaging to assess in situ expression of 78 immune and pancreas cell markers, including vascular and lymphatic annotation with signatures of inflammation, extravasation/trafficking, and immune cell residency in autoantibody positive (autoantibody positive) and type 1 diabetes donors as compared to donors with type 2 diabetes (type 2 diabetes) and non-diabetic controls available through the Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes) repository. We will compare insulin containing versus insulin negative islets, within and across donors, to identify empty beta cells and determine how they correlate with islet, acinar, and immune cell phenotypes. These data will serve as a template for a serial section to undergo laser capture microdissection (laser capture microdissection) of insulin containing islets, insulin negative islets, and acinar tissue regions, which will be subjected to bulk RNAseq as well as our novel method for quantifying beta cells based on DNA methylation patterns. In addition, we will use a novel mouse model (beta cell-specific, tamoxifen-inducible Adar1-mutant) and cultured human pancreas slices to functionally interrogate molecular pathways underlying the formation of empty beta cells. Specifically, we propose to leverage these two model systems to test therapeutic candidatesincluding an incretin mimetic (GLP1), an endoplasmic reticulum (endoplasmic reticulum) stress inhibitor (ISRIB), and multiple biologics targeting specific immune subsetsfor their ability to modulate empty beta cells, their insulin content and insulin secretion. We will then correlate these functional data with molecular and cellular features of hormone negative islet cells via MACSima, RNAseq, and DNA methylation. These studies are expected to yield insights into a fundamental yet little understood process taking place in human type 1 diabetes. We anticipate that empty beta cells can be re-functionalized, paving the way for therapeutic development to restore endogenous beta cell function in type 1 diabetes. Ultimately, when combined with effective interventions to constrain autoimmunity, it is our hope that the metabolic modalities explored here could provide a means to reduce insulin requirements or even achieve insulin independence after type 1 diabetes onset, dramatically improving longevity and quality of life for these patients.",5,5U01DK135001-03,RFA-DK-21-017,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,12,2,0,0

Thus, the development of novel therapies for relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia represents an urgent unmet medical need in children. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1) mediates the conversion of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in the mammalian transcriptome. Malignant Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 activation and over-editing was reported in extensively reported in adult cancer type. As a result, there is an intense interest to understand the mechanisms by which Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1-directed A-to-I RNA editing regulates gene expression, and how these editing events influence tumorigenesis. However, the global landscape of A-to-I RNA editing in pediatric cancer has not been systematically characterized. Fulfilling this knowledge gap will allow mechanistic and functional studies of these RNA editing modifications that can ultimately aid in formulating new therapeutic and preventive strategies. We discovered that 70% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients exhibit high expression of Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1, and this is associated with a significantly worse clinical outcome. Our RNA editing analysis of over 260 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients revealed wide-spread A-to-I RNA mutations in the relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cohort. Strikingly, we found that inhibiting Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 impairs malignant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia progenitor propogation. These discoveries need to be validated in a large cohort of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients to further delineate the critical RNA editing ""mutations"" associated with relapse. The overall objective of this study is to leverage on the large sample size in Kids First Program to fully understand the heterogenous RNA editing landscape in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia pathogenesis. Our central hypothesis that Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 promotes unique A-to-I RNA editing changes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia which drives disease relapse and therapeutic resistance. In this proposal, we will 1) define the Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1-controlled A-to-I RNA editing landscape in 1,304 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients by combining the Kids First and NCI TARGET datasets, 2) identify novel RNA editing events that predict disease outcome, and 3) compare the RNA editing landscapes in various molecular subtypes to reveal any critical link between RNA editing and genetic background.

Thus, the development of novel therapies for relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia represents an urgent unmet medical need in children. Relapsed/refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is often enriched with leukemia initiating cells (leukemia initiating cells), which exhibit enhanced survival and self-renewal capacity. Our long-term goal is to identify new targets for development of less toxic and more effective therapies by eliminating this cell population. We discovered that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1) activation is required LIC maintenance by directing cell-type-specific gene programs to prevent interferon activation and aberrant doublestranded RNA (doublestranded RNA) sensing. Approximately 70% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients exhibit high expression of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1, and this is associated with a significantly worse clinical outcome. Strikingly, we found that inhibiting adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 impairs malignant T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia progenitor prorogation. These data suggest that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 has a fundamental role in LIC selfrenewal and therapeutic resistance in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The overall objective of this study is to dissect the mechanism through which adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 and RNA editing promote LIC self-renewal in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Our central hypothesis is that activation of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 supports T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia LIC maintenance by suppressing aberrant doublestranded RNA sensing in an isoform-specific manner. We will test this hypothesis in three independent aims: 1) Examine if adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 promotes LIC self-renewal in relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by increasing RNA editing, 2) elucidate the molecular mechanism by which adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 promotes LIC activity, and 3) investigate if NOTCH1 signaling induces adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 activation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia LIC. We will directly evaluate the isoform-specific function of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 p150 and p110 isoforms in leukemia initiating cells within human thymic organoids and patient-derived xenograft mouse models of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We will use single cell RNA-sequencing to investigate the mechanisms by which p150 and p110 isoforms regulate cellular function and gene expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia leukemia initiating cells. In Aim 2, we will perform concurrent knockdown of doublestranded RNA sensors in combination with adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 isoform knockout in leukemia initiating cells to determine if aberrant doublestranded RNA sensing disrupts LIC activities in patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, we will map doublestranded RNA-containing genes suppressed by either RNA editing or doublestranded RNA activity of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1. In Aim 3, we will use g-secretase inhibitor (g-secretase inhibitor) and DDL1-expressing thymic co-culture system to examine if NOTCH signaling contributes to adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 activation, and if ectopic expression of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 can bypass the need for NOTCH signaling and induces resistance to g-secretase inhibitor inhibition. Lastly, we will investigate if adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 is a direct transcriptional target of NOTCH1. These studies will improve our understanding of how dysregulation of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 contributes to LIC self-renewal and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia progression. Furthermore, these studies will expand our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying leukemia initiating cells-driven malignancies and may be broadly applicable to other cancer stem cell-driven malignancies.",1,1R01CA282792-01A1,PA-20-185,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,16,0,4,4

There is little understanding of how brain systems that can normally suppress unproductive reward seeking are modified by opioid use and causally contribute to opioid seeking. This is in part due to technical feasibility, as measuring adaptations in single neurons across the onset, maintenance, and relapse phases of opioid use is challenging. Here, I overcome this issue using a novel assay developed in my lab, wherein I longitudinally track activity in precisely defined neurons throughout heroin self-administration, extinction, and reinstatement using two-photon calcium imaging in head-restrained mice. We test the overarching hypothesis that a thalamostriatal subcircuit is inhibited by opioid use and by the presentation of stimuli that initiate opioidseeking behaviors. In support of this hypothesis, my preliminary data suggest that posterior paraventricular thalamic neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (posterior paraventricular thalamic neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens) become hypoactive and hypoexcitable as a result of repeated heroin use and display rapid reductions in activity during cueand drug-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. Furthermore, I show that optogenetically mimicking this inhibition during extinction initiates heroin seeking. To test my specific hypotheses, in Aim 1, I will longitudinally track the activity dynamics of single posterior paraventricular thalamic neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens neurons and neuronal ensembles throughout heroin self-administration, extinction, and reinstatement. In Aim 2, I will evaluate the long-lasting intrinsic and synaptic adaptations among posterior paraventricular thalamic neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens neurons at multiple timepoints following heroin self-administration. In Aim 3, I will determine the function of posterior paraventricular thalamic neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens neuronal activity for the suppression of heroin seeking during extinction, and expression of heroin seeking during reinstatement. Overall, this project will identify how a brain circuit that inhibits reward seeking in inappropriate conditions is modified by opioid use and causally influences opioid-seeking behavior.",5,5R01DA054271-03,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE,0,1,8,1

Cognitive symptoms are a hallmark of the disease, affecting most individuals with schizophrenia, and being responsible for the greatest reduction in quality of life. Despite their significant impact, the biological mechanisms of cognitive deficits remain elusive, in part due to limitations of the experimental approaches typically used to study them in humans. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach using biophysical modeling as an explanatory theoretical framework for bridging the translational gap between previous preclinical work in mouse models of schizophrenia-relevant risk and the proposed work in patients with schizophrenia. We propose translation of the findings of reduced neuronal ensemble reliability (neuronal ensemble reliability) in the primary visual cortex (V1) as a window into a brain-wide circuit-level alteration in schizophrenia and its relationship to cognitive deficits. To achieve this, we will use a combined sample of 1,760 individuals, including healthy individuals, patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and their first-degree relatives, from the HCP Young Adult, HCP Psychosis, and HCP Early Psychosis projects. Specifically, we will measure voxel ensemble reliability (voxel ensemble reliability) in humans using resting-state and visual-stimulation fMRI data-akin to calcium imaging studies in miceas a theoretically grounded and translational index of excitation-inhibition balance (excitation-inhibition balance) in cortical circuits. First, we aim to develop a biophysical model of V1 constrained by preclinical and basic neuroscience experiments, and test model predications of neuroimaging measures related to excitation-inhibition balance. Second, we will test for reduced voxel ensemble reliability in patients with schizophrenia-directly translating preclinical findings-and use biophysical model simulations to identify potential biological mechanisms. Third, we will use the unique sample characteristics of the HCP Psychosis project (patients and first-degree relatives) to investigate the relationship between genetic burden for schizophrenia and voxel ensemble reliability. Fourth, given the convergence of cognitive deficits in the preclinical mouse models, we will examine the relationship between voxel ensemble reliability and cognitive performance. We will further seek to establish reduced voxel ensemble reliability as a brain-wide mechanism of cognitive deficits by testing for relationships in cognition across disparate sensory domains. Throughout, we will use well-powered, rigorous, state-of-the-art fMRI and statistical data-driven methods suitable for large-scale studies and HCP-like fMRI sequences, including cross-validation and independent confirmation. Together with a strong theoretical foundation and using biophysical modeling to complement fMRI analyses, this approach will begin to elucidate the biological mechanisms of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. In doing so, this project will establish voxel ensemble reliability as a fully translational neuroimaging measure with the potential to be used as a biomarker for treatment selection and target engagement and will generate predictions that can be directly tested in preclinical studies.",1,1R01MH134973-01,PA-20-185,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,0,1,5,1
