# NIH Topic Explorer

This project presents an interactive visualization of research topics derived from NIH-funded grant applications using AI-based topic modeling. It helps researchers, policymakers, and the public explore the scientific focus of NIH funding across different institutes and topic groupings.

## 🔍 What You Can Do

- Explore NIH research topics across multiple levels of granularity (K = 5, 10, 15, 20)
- See which topics receive the most applications
- Understand which NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) fund each topic
- Download the underlying dataset
